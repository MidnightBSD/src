.Sh NAME
.Nm bwi
.Nd Broadcom BCM430x/4318 IEEE 802.11b/g wireless network driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
following line in
.Pa /boot/loader.conf :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
if_bwi_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for Broadcom BCM430x/4318 wireless network adapters.
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Ss MIB Variables
The following per-interface variables are implemented in the
.Va hw.bwi Ns Em X
branch of the
.Xr sysctl 3
MIB.
.Bl -tag -width ".Va txpwr_calib"
.It Va debug
Debug flags.
.It Va dwell_time
Channel dwell time during scan (msec).
.It Va fw_version
Firmware version.
.It Va led_idle
Number of ticks before LED enters idle state.
.It Va led_blink
Allow LED to blink.
.It Va txpwr_calib
Enable software TX power calibration.
.El
.Sh HARDWARE
The following cards are among those supported by the
.Nm
driver:
.Pp
.Bl -column -compact "Buffalo WLI-PCI-G54S" "BCM4318" "CardBus" "b/g" -offset 6n
.Em "Card	Chip	Bus	Standard"
Linksys WPC54Gv3	BCM4318	CardBus	b/g
Linksys WPC54GSv2	BCM4318	CardBus	b/g
Buffalo WLI-CB-G54S	BCM4318	CardBus	b/g
Buffalo WLI-PCI-G54S	BCM4306	PCI	b/g
Dell Wireless 1470	BCM4318	Mini PCI	b/g
Dell Truemobile 1400	BCM4309	Mini PCI	b/g
.El
.Sh FILES
The firmware for the adapter is not shipped with
.Mx
and must be obtained separately.
An archive with firmware files that are known to work can be found at:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
http://leaf.dragonflybsd.org/~sephe/bwi/v3.tbz
.Ed
.Pp
The firmware files are built as part of the bwifw module and
must be loaded for
.Nm
to work. Place the files in 
.Pa /usr/src/sys/contrib/dev/bwi
and build bwifw in
.Pa /usr/src/sys/modules/bwifw

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Dx 1.11
and
.Mx 0.3
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Sepherosa Ziehau .
It was later ported to
.Fx 7.0 ,
then brought into 
.Mx 0.3
by 
.An Lucas Holt .
.Pp
The hardware specification was reverse engineered by the people at
.Pa http://bcm-specs.sipsolutions.net .
Thanks go also to johill and mb on the #bcm-specs channel.
.Sh BUGS
BCM4306 and BCM4309 chips do not work properly on channel 1, 2 and 3.
