.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Nx 1.5 ;
.Ox
support was added in
.Ox 3.4 ;
.Fx
support was added in
.Fx 8.0 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Bill Squier
and ported to
.Ox 3.4
by
.An Alexander Yurchenko Aq grange@openbsd.org .
The driver was largely rewritten for
.Ox 3.9
by
.An Mark Kettenis Aq kettenis@openbsd.org .
The driver was then ported to
.Fx
by
.An Constantine A. Murenin Aq cnst@FreeBSD.org
as a part of a Google Summer of Code 2007 project.
.Sh CAVEATS
Some vendors connect these chips to non-standard thermal diodes and
resistors.
This will result in bogus sensor values.
.Sh BUGS
Interrupt support is unimplemented.
.Pp
There are currently no known pnpbios IDs assigned to LM chips.
.Pp
This driver attaches to the Winbond W83791SD chip even though that
chip does not have any sensors.
