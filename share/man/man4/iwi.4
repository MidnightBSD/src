.Sh NAME
.Nm iwi
.Nd "Intel PRO/Wireless 2200BG/2225BG/2915ABG IEEE 802.11 driver"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device iwi"
.Cd "device pci"
.Cd "device wlan"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
if_iwi_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for
.Tn Intel
PRO/Wireless 2200BG/2915ABG MiniPCI and 2225BG PCI network adapters.
.Pp
By default, the
.Nm
driver configures the adapter for BSS operation (aka infrastructure mode).
This mode requires the use of an access point.
.Pp
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Pp
This driver requires firmware to be loaded before it will work.
You need to obtain
.Xr iwicontrol 8
from the IWI web page listed below to accomplish loading the firmware
before
.Xr ifconfig 8
will work.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Join an existing BSS network (i.e., connect to an access point):
.Pp
.Dl "ifconfig iwi0 inet 192.168.0.20 netmask 0xffffff00"
.Pp
Join a specific BSS network with network name
.Dq Li my_net :
.Pp
.Dl "ifconfig iwi0 inet 192.168.0.20 netmask 0xffffff00 ssid my_net"
.Pp
Join a specific BSS network with 64-bit WEP encryption:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ifconfig iwi0 inet 192.168.0.20 netmask 0xffffff00 ssid my_net \e
    wepmode on wepkey 0x1234567890
.Ed
.Pp
Join a specific BSS network with 128-bit WEP encryption:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ifconfig iwi0 inet 192.168.0.20 netmask 0xffffff00 ssid my_net \e
    wepmode on wepkey 0x01020304050607080910111213
.Ed
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "iwi%d: device timeout"
The driver will reset the hardware.
This should not happen.
.It "iwi%d: Please load firmware"
The required firmware has not been loaded into the card, and therefore
the card cannot operate.
Load the firmware with
.Xr iwicontrol 8
before proceeding.
