.Sh NAME
.Nm vinum
.Nd Logical Volume Manager
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "device vinum"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a logical volume manager inspired by, but not derived from, the Veritas
Volume Manager.
It provides the following features:
.Bl -bullet
.It
It provides device-independent logical disks, called
.Em volumes .
Volumes are
not restricted to the size of any disk on the system.
.It
The volumes consist of one or more
.Em plexes ,
each of which contain the
entire address space of a volume.
This represents an implementation of RAID-1
(mirroring).
Multiple plexes can also be used for:
.\" XXX What about sparse plexes?  Do we want them?
.Bl -bullet
.It
Increased read throughput.
.Nm
will read data from the least active disk, so if a volume has plexes on multiple
disks, more data can be read in parallel.
.Nm
reads data from only one plex, but it writes data to all plexes.
.It
Increased reliability.
By storing plexes on different disks, data will remain
available even if one of the plexes becomes unavailable.
In comparison with a
RAID-5 plex (see below), using multiple plexes requires more storage space, but
gives better performance, particularly in the case of a drive failure.
.It
Additional plexes can be used for on-line data reorganization.
By attaching an
additional plex and subsequently detaching one of the older plexes, data can be
moved on-line without compromising access.
.It
An additional plex can be used to obtain a consistent dump of a file system.
By
attaching an additional plex and detaching at a specific time, the detached plex
becomes an accurate snapshot of the file system at the time of detachment.
.\" Make sure to flush!
.El
.It
Each plex consists of one or more logical disk slices, called
.Em subdisks .
Subdisks are defined as a contiguous block of physical disk storage.
A plex may
consist of any reasonable number of subdisks (in other words, the real limit is
not the number, but other factors, such as memory and performance, associated
with maintaining a large number of subdisks).
.It
A number of mappings between subdisks and plexes are available:
.Bl -bullet
.It
.Em "Concatenated plexes"
consist of one or more subdisks, each of which
is mapped to a contiguous part of the plex address space.
.It
.Em "Striped plexes"
consist of two or more subdisks of equal size.
The file
address space is mapped in
.Em stripes ,
integral fractions of the subdisk
size.
Consecutive plex address space is mapped to stripes in each subdisk in
turn.

..
.\}
The subdisks of a striped plex must all be the same size.
.It
.Em "RAID-5 plexes"
require at least three equal-sized subdisks.
They
resemble striped plexes, except that in each stripe, one subdisk stores parity
information.
This subdisk changes in each stripe: in the first stripe, it is the
first subdisk, in the second it is the second subdisk, etc.
In the event of a
single disk failure,
.Nm
will recover the data based on the information stored on the remaining subdisks.
This mapping is particularly suited to read-intensive access.
The subdisks of a
RAID-5 plex must all be the same size.
.\" Make sure to flush!
.El
.It
.Em Drives
are the lowest level of the storage hierarchy.
They represent disk special
devices.
.It
.Nm
offers automatic startup.
Unlike
.Ux
file systems,
.Nm
volumes contain all the configuration information needed to ensure that they are
started correctly when the subsystem is enabled.
This is also a significant
advantage over the Veritas\(tm File System.
This feature regards the presence
of the volumes.
It does not mean that the volumes will be mounted
automatically, since the standard startup procedures with
.Pa /etc/fstab
perform this function.
.El
.Sh KERNEL CONFIGURATION
.Nm
is currently supplied as a KLD module, and does not require
configuration.
As with other KLDs, it is absolutely necessary to match the KLD
to the version of the operating system.
Failure to do so will cause
.Nm
to issue an error message and terminate.
.Pp
It is possible to configure
.Nm
in the kernel, but this is not recommended.
To do so, add this line to the
kernel configuration file:
.Pp
.D1 Cd "device vinum"
.Ss Debug Options
The current version of
.Nm ,
both the kernel module and the user program
.Xr gvinum 8 ,
include significant debugging support.
It is not recommended to remove
this support at the moment, but if you do you must remove it from both the
kernel and the user components.
To do this, edit the files
.Pa /usr/src/sbin/vinum/Makefile
and
.Pa /usr/src/sys/modules/vinum/Makefile
and edit the
.Va CFLAGS
variable to remove the
.Li -DVINUMDEBUG
option.
If you have
configured
.Nm
into the kernel, either specify the line
.Pp
.D1 Cd "options VINUMDEBUG"
.Pp
in the kernel configuration file or remove the
.Li -DVINUMDEBUG
option from
.Pa /usr/src/sbin/vinum/Makefile
as described above.
.Pp
If the
.Va VINUMDEBUG
variables do not match,
.Xr gvinum 8
will fail with a message
explaining the problem and what to do to correct it.
.Ss Other Options
.Cd "options VINUM_AUTOSTART"
.Pp
Make
.Nm
automatically scan all available disks at attach time.
This is a deprecated way that is primarily intended for environments
that do not want to rely on kernel environment variables set by
.Xr loader 8 .
.Pp
.Nm
was previously available in two versions: a freely available version which did
not contain RAID-5 functionality, and a full version including RAID-5
functionality, which was available only from Cybernet Systems Inc.
The present
version of
.Nm
includes the RAID-5 functionality.
.Sh RUNNING VINUM
.Nm
is part of the base
.Fx
system.
It does not require installation.
To start it, start the
.Xr gvinum 8
program, which will load the KLD if it is not already present.
Before using
.Nm ,
it must be configured.
See
.Xr gvinum 8
for information on how to create a
.Nm
configuration.
.Pp
Normally, you start a configured version of
.Nm
at boot time.
Set the variable
.Va start_vinum
in
.Pa /etc/rc.conf
to
.Dq Li YES
to start
.Nm
at boot time.
(See
.Xr rc.conf 5
for more details.)
.Pp
If
.Nm
is loaded as a KLD (the recommended way), the
.Nm vinum Cm stop
command will unload it
(see
.Xr gvinum 8 ) .
You can also do this with the
.Xr kldunload 8
command.
.Pp
The KLD can only be unloaded when idle, in other words when no volumes are
mounted and no other instances of the
.Xr gvinum 8
program are active.
Unloading the KLD does not harm the data in the volumes.
.Ss Configuring and Starting Objects
Use the
.Xr gvinum 8
utility to configure and start
.Nm
objects.
.Sh AUTOMATIC STARTUP
The
.Nm
subsystem can be automatically started at attach time.
There are two kernel environment variables that can be set in
.Xr loader.conf 5
to accomplish this.
.Bl -tag -width ".Va vinum.autostart" -offset indent
.It Va vinum.autostart
If this variable is set (to any value), the attach function will attempt
to scan all available disks for valid
.Nm
configuration records.
This is the preferred way if automatic startup is desired.
.Pp
Example:
.Dl vinum.autostart="YES"
.It Va vinum.drives
Alternatively, this variable can enumerate a list of disk devices
to scan for configuration records.
Note that only the
.Dq bare
device names need to be given, since
.Nm
will automatically scan all possible slices and partitions.
.Pp
Example:
.Dl vinum.drives="da0 da1"
.El
.Pp
If automatic startup is used, it is not necessary to set the
.Va start_vinum
variable of
.Xr rc.conf 5 .
Note that if
.Nm
is to supply to the volume for the root file system, it is necessary
to start the subsystem early.
This can be achieved by specifying
.Pp
.Dl vinum_load="YES"
.Pp
in
.Xr loader.conf 5 .
.Sh IOCTL CALLS
.Xr ioctl 2
calls are intended for the use of the
.Xr gvinum 8
configuration program only.
They are described in the header file
.Pa /sys/dev/vinum/vinumio.h .
.Ss Disk Labels
Conventional disk special devices have a
.Em "disk label"
in the second sector of the device.
This disk label describes the layout of the partitions within
the device.
.Nm
does not subdivide volumes, so volumes do not contain a physical disk label.
For convenience,
.Nm
implements the ioctl calls
.Dv DIOCGDINFO
(get disk label),
.Dv DIOCGPART
(get partition information),
.Dv DIOCWDINFO
(write partition information) and
.Dv DIOCSDINFO
(set partition information).
.Dv DIOCGDINFO
and
.Dv DIOCGPART
refer to an internal
representation of the disk label which is not present on the volume.
As a
result, the
.Fl r
option of
.Xr disklabel 8 ,
which reads the
.Dq "raw disk" ,
will fail.
.Pp
In general,
.Xr disklabel 8
serves no useful purpose on a
.Nm
volume.
If you run it, it will show you
three partitions,
.Ql a ,
.Ql b
and
.Ql c ,
all the same except for the
.Va fstype ,
for example:
.Bd -literal
3 partitions:
#        size   offset    fstype   [fsize bsize bps/cpg]
  a:     2048        0    4.2BSD     1024  8192     0   # (Cyl.    0 - 0)
  b:     2048        0      swap                        # (Cyl.    0 - 0)
  c:     2048        0    unused        0     0         # (Cyl.    0 - 0)
.Ed
.Pp
.Nm
ignores the
.Dv DIOCWDINFO
and
.Dv DIOCSDINFO
ioctls, since there is nothing to change.
As a result, any attempt to modify the disk label will be silently ignored.
.Sh MAKING FILE SYSTEMS
Since
.Nm
volumes do not contain partitions, the names do not need to conform to the
standard rules for naming disk partitions.
For a physical disk partition, the
last letter of the device name specifies the partition identifier (a to h).
.Nm
volumes need not conform to this convention, but if they do not,
.Xr newfs 8
will complain that it cannot determine the partition.
To solve this problem,
use the
.Fl v
flag to
.Xr newfs 8 .
For example, if you have a volume
.Pa concat ,
use the following command to create a UFS file system on it:
.Pp
.Dl "newfs -v /dev/vinum/concat"
.Sh OBJECT NAMING
.Nm
assigns default names to plexes and subdisks, although they may be overridden.
We do not recommend overriding the default names.
Experience with the
Veritas\(tm
volume manager, which allows arbitrary naming of objects, has shown that this
flexibility does not bring a significant advantage, and it can cause confusion.
.Pp
Names may contain any non-blank character, but it is recommended to restrict
them to letters, digits and the underscore characters.
The names of volumes,
plexes and subdisks may be up to 64 characters long, and the names of drives may
up to 32 characters long.
When choosing volume and plex names, bear in mind
that automatically generated plex and subdisk names are longer than the name
from which they are derived.
.Bl -bullet
.It
When
.Nm
creates or deletes objects, it creates a directory
.Pa /dev/vinum ,
in which it makes device entries for each volume it finds.
It also creates
subdirectories,
.Pa /dev/vinum/plex
and
.Pa /dev/vinum/sd ,
in which it stores device entries for plexes and subdisks.
In addition, it creates two more directories,
.Pa /dev/vinum/vol
and
.Pa /dev/vinum/drive ,
in which it stores hierarchical information for volumes and drives.
.It
In addition,
.Nm
creates three super-devices,
.Pa /dev/vinum/control ,
.Pa /dev/vinum/Control
and
.Pa /dev/vinum/controld .
.Pa /dev/vinum/control
is used by
.Xr gvinum 8
when it has been compiled without the
.Dv VINUMDEBUG
option,
.Pa /dev/vinum/Control
is used by
.Xr gvinum 8
when it has been compiled with the
.Dv VINUMDEBUG
option, and
.Pa /dev/vinum/controld
is used by the
.Nm
daemon.
The two control devices for
.Xr gvinum 8
are used to synchronize the debug status of kernel and user modules.
.It
Unlike
.Ux
drives,
.Nm
volumes are not subdivided into partitions, and thus do not contain a disk
label.
Unfortunately, this confuses a number of utilities, notably
.Xr newfs 8 ,
which normally tries to interpret the last letter of a
.Nm
volume name as a partition identifier.
If you use a volume name which does not
end in the letters
.Ql a
to
.Ql c ,
you must use the
.Fl v
flag to
.Xr newfs 8
in order to tell it to ignore this convention.
.\"
.It
Plexes do not need to be assigned explicit names.
By default, a plex name is
the name of the volume followed by the letters
.Pa .p
and the number of the
plex.
For example, the plexes of volume
.Pa vol3
are called
.Pa vol3.p0 , vol3.p1
and so on.
These names can be overridden, but it is not recommended.
.It
Like plexes, subdisks are assigned names automatically, and explicit naming is
discouraged.
A subdisk name is the name of the plex followed by the letters
.Pa .s
and a number identifying the subdisk.
For example, the subdisks of
plex
.Pa vol3.p0
are called
.Pa vol3.p0.s0 , vol3.p0.s1
and so on.
.It
By contrast,
.Em drives
must be named.
This makes it possible to move a drive to a different location
and still recognize it automatically.
Drive names may be up to 32 characters
long.
.El

.Nm
objects described in the section

In the case of unattached plexes and subdisks, the naming is reversed.
Subdisks
are named after the disk on which they are located, and plexes are named after
the subdisk.
.\" XXX

This mapping is still to be determined.
.Ef
.Ss Object States
Each
.Nm
object has a
.Em state
associated with it.
.Nm
uses this state to determine the handling of the object.
.Ss Volume States
Volumes may have the following states:
.Bl -hang -width 14n
.It Em down
The volume is completely inaccessible.
.It Em up
The volume is up and at least partially functional.
Not all plexes may be
available.
.El
.Ss "Plex States"
Plexes may have the following states:
.Bl -hang -width 14n
.It Em referenced
A plex entry which has been referenced as part of a volume, but which is
currently not known.
.It Em faulty
A plex which has gone completely down because of I/O errors.
.It Em down
A plex which has been taken down by the administrator.
.It Em initializing
A plex which is being initialized.
.El
.Pp
The remaining states represent plexes which are at least partially up.
.Bl -hang -width 14n
.It Em corrupt
A plex entry which is at least partially up.
Not all subdisks are available,
and an inconsistency has occurred.
If no other plex is uncorrupted, the volume
is no longer consistent.
.It Em degraded
A RAID-5 plex entry which is accessible, but one subdisk is down, requiring
recovery for many I/O requests.
.It Em flaky
A plex which is really up, but which has a reborn subdisk which we do not
completely trust, and which we do not want to read if we can avoid it.
.It Em up
A plex entry which is completely up.
All subdisks are up.
.El
.Ss "Subdisk States"
Subdisks can have the following states:
.Bl -hang -width 14n
.It Em empty
A subdisk entry which has been created completely.
All fields are correct, and
the disk has been updated, but the on the disk is not valid.
.It Em referenced
A subdisk entry which has been referenced as part of a plex, but which is
currently not known.
.It Em initializing
A subdisk entry which has been created completely and which is currently being
initialized.
.El
.Pp
The following states represent invalid data.
.Bl -hang -width 14n
.It Em obsolete
A subdisk entry which has been created completely.
All fields are correct, the
config on disk has been updated, and the data was valid, but since then the
drive has been taken down, and as a result updates have been missed.
.It Em stale
A subdisk entry which has been created completely.
All fields are correct, the
disk has been updated, and the data was valid, but since then the drive has been
crashed and updates have been lost.
.El
.Pp
The following states represent valid, inaccessible data.
.Bl -hang -width 14n
.It Em crashed
A subdisk entry which has been created completely.
All fields are correct, the
disk has been updated, and the data was valid, but since then the drive has gone
down.
No attempt has been made to write to the subdisk since the crash, so the
data is valid.
.It Em down
A subdisk entry which was up, which contained valid data, and which was taken
down by the administrator.
The data is valid.
.It Em reviving
The subdisk is currently in the process of being revived.
We can write but not
read.
.El
.Pp
The following states represent accessible subdisks with valid data.
.Bl -hang -width 14n
.It Em reborn
A subdisk entry which has been created completely.
All fields are correct, the
disk has been updated, and the data was valid, but since then the drive has gone
down and up again.
No updates were lost, but it is possible that the subdisk
has been damaged.
We will not read from this subdisk if we have a choice.
If this
is the only subdisk which covers this address space in the plex, we set its
state to up under these circumstances, so this status implies that there is
another subdisk to fulfill the request.
.It Em up
A subdisk entry which has been created completely.
All fields are correct, the
disk has been updated, and the data is valid.
.El
.Ss "Drive States"
Drives can have the following states:
.Bl -hang -width 14n
.It Em referenced
At least one subdisk refers to the drive, but it is not currently accessible to
the system.
No device name is known.
.It Em down
The drive is not accessible.
.It Em up
The drive is up and running.

.Sh HISTORY
.Nm
first appeared in
.Fx 3.0 .
The RAID-5 component of
.Nm
was developed by Cybernet Inc.\&
.Pq Pa http://www.cybernet.com/ ,
for its NetMAX product.
.Sh AUTHORS
.An Greg Lehey Aq grog@lemis.com .
.Sh BUGS
.Nm
is a new product.
Bugs can be expected.
The configuration mechanism is not yet
fully functional.
If you have difficulties, please look at the section
.Sx "DEBUGGING PROBLEMS WITH VINUM"
before reporting problems.
.Pp
Kernels with the
.Nm
device appear to work, but are not supported.
If you have trouble with
this configuration, please first replace the kernel with a
.No non- Ns Nm
kernel and test with the KLD module.
.Pp
Detection of differences between the version of the kernel and the KLD is not
yet implemented.
.Pp
The RAID-5 functionality is new in
.Fx 3.3 .
Some problems have been
reported with
.Nm
in combination with soft updates, but these are not reproducible on all
systems.
If you are planning to use
.Nm
in a production environment, please test carefully.
.Sh DEBUGGING PROBLEMS WITH VINUM
Solving problems with
.Nm
can be a difficult affair.
This section suggests some approaches.
.Ss Configuration problems
It is relatively easy (too easy) to run into problems with the
.Nm
configuration.
If you do, the first thing you should do is stop configuration
updates:
.Pp
.Dl "vinum setdaemon 4"
.Pp
This will stop updates and any further corruption of the on-disk configuration.
.Pp
Next, look at the on-disk configuration, using a Bourne-style shell:
.Bd -literal
rm -f log
for i in /dev/da0s1h /dev/da1s1h /dev/da2s1h /dev/da3s1h; do
  (dd if=$i skip=8 count=6|tr -d '\e000-\e011\e200-\e377'; echo) >> log
done
.Ed
.Pp
The names of the devices are the names of all
.Nm
slices.
The file
.Pa log
should then contain something like this:
.Bd -literal
.if t .ps -3
.if t .vs -3

.Pp
The first line contains the
.Nm
label and must start with the text
.Dq Li "IN VINO" .
It also contains the name of the system.
The exact definition is contained in
.Pa /usr/src/sys/dev/vinum/vinumvar.h .
The saved configuration starts in the middle of the line with the text
.Dq Li "volume obj state up"
and starts in sector 9 of the disk.
The rest of the output shows the remainder of the on-disk configuration.
It
may be necessary to increase the
.Cm count
argument of
.Xr dd 1
in order to see the complete configuration.
.Pp
The configuration on all disks should be the same.
If this is not the case,
please report the problem with the exact contents of the file
.Pa log .
There is probably little that can be done to recover the on-disk configuration,
but if you keep a copy of the files used to create the objects, you should be
able to re-create them.
The
.Ic create
command does not change the subdisk data, so this will not cause data
corruption.
You may need to use the
.Ic resetconfig
command if you have this kind of trouble.
.Ss Kernel Panics
In order to analyse a panic which you suspect comes from
.Nm
you will need to build a debug kernel.
See the online handbook at
.Pa /usr/share/doc/en/books/developers-handbook/kerneldebug.html
(if installed) or
.Pa http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/developers-\%handbook/kerneldebug.html
for more details of how to do this.
.Pp
Perform the following steps to analyse a
.Nm
problem:
.Bl -enum
.It
Copy the following files to the directory in which you will be
performing the analysis, typically
.Pa /var/crash :
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
.Pa /usr/src/sys/modules/vinum/.gdbinit.crash ,
.It
.Pa /usr/src/sys/modules/vinum/.gdbinit.kernel ,
.It
.Pa /usr/src/sys/modules/vinum/.gdbinit.serial ,
.It
.Pa /usr/src/sys/modules/vinum/.gdbinit.vinum
and
.It
.Pa /usr/src/sys/modules/vinum/.gdbinit.vinum.paths
.El
.It
Make sure that you build the
.Nm
module with debugging information.
The standard
.Pa Makefile
builds a module with debugging symbols by default.
If the version of
.Nm
in
.Pa /boot/kernel
does not contain symbols, you will not get an error message, but the stack trace
will not show the symbols.
Check the module before starting
.Xr gdb 1 :
.Bd -literal
$ file /boot/kernel/vinum.ko
/boot/kernel/vinum.ko: ELF 32-bit LSB shared object, Intel 80386,
  version 1 (FreeBSD), not stripped
.Ed
.Pp
If the output shows that
.Pa /boot/kernel/vinum.ko
is stripped, you will have to find a version which is not.
Usually this will be
either in
.Pa /usr/obj/sys/modules/vinum/vinum.ko
(if you have built
.Nm
with a
.Dq Li "make world" )
or
.Pa /usr/src/sys/modules/vinum/vinum.ko
(if you have built
.Nm
in this directory).
Modify the file
.Pa .gdbinit.vinum.paths
accordingly.
.It
Either take a dump or use remote serial
.Xr gdb 1
to analyse the problem.
To analyse a dump, say
.Pa /var/crash/vmcore.5 ,
link
.Pa /var/crash/.gdbinit.crash
to
.Pa /var/crash/.gdbinit
and enter:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
cd /var/crash
gdb -k kernel.debug vmcore.5
.Ed
.Pp
This example assumes that you have installed the correct debug kernel at
.Pa /var/crash/kernel.debug .
If not, substitute the correct name of the debug kernel.
.Pp
To perform remote serial debugging,
link
.Pa /var/crash/.gdbinit.serial
to
.Pa /var/crash/.gdbinit
and enter
.Bd -literal -offset indent
cd /var/crash
gdb -k kernel.debug
.Ed
.Pp
In this case, the
.Pa .gdbinit
file performs the functions necessary to establish connection.
The remote
machine must already be in debug mode: enter the kernel debugger and select
.Ic gdb
(see
.Xr ddb 4
for more details).
The serial
.Pa .gdbinit
file expects the serial connection to run at 38400 bits per second; if you run
at a different speed, edit the file accordingly (look for the
.Va remotebaud
specification).
.Pp
The following example shows a remote debugging session using the
.Ic debug
command of
.Xr gvinum 8 :

.Pp
When entering from the debugger, it is important that the source of frame 1
(listed by the
.Pa .gdbinit
file at the top of the example) contains the text
.Dq Li "Debugger (\*[q]vinum debug\*[q]);" .
.Pp
This is an indication that the address specifications are correct.
If you get
some other output, your symbols and the kernel module are out of sync, and the
trace will be meaningless.

For an initial investigation, the most important information is the output of
