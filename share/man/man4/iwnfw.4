.Sh NAME
.Nm iwnfw
.Nd "Firmware Module for Intel Wireless driver"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this module into the kernel,
place the following line in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device iwnfw"
.Ed
.Pp
This will include three firmware images inside the kernel.
If you want to pick only the firmware image for your network adapter choose one
of the following:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device iwn4965fw"
.Cd "device iwn1000fw"
.Cd "device iwn5000fw"
.Cd "device iwn5150fw"
.Cd "device iwn6000fw"
.Cd "device iwn6000g2afw"
.Cd "device iwn6000g2bfw"
.Cd "device iwn6050fw"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
iwn4965fw_load="YES"
iwn1000fw_load="YES"
iwn5000fw_load="YES"
iwn5150fw_load="YES"
iwn6000fw_load="YES"
iwn6000g2afw_load="YES"
iwn6000g2bfw_load="YES"
iwn6050fw_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This module provides access to firmware sets for the
Intel Wireless WiFi Link 4965, 1000, 5000 and 6000 series of
IEEE 802.11n adapters.
It may be
statically linked into the kernel, or loaded as a module.
