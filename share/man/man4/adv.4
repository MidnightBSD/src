.Sh DESCRIPTION
This driver provides access to the 8bit
.Tn SCSI
bus connected to the Advanced Systems Products, Inc.
.Tn ASC900 ,
.Tn ASC1000 ,
.Tn ASC1090 ,
.Tn ASC1200 ,
.Tn ASC3030 ,
.Tn ASC3050 ,
and
.Tn ASC3150
host adapter chips.

This board has been shipped by HP with the 4020i CD-R drive.
The board has no BIOS so it cannot control a boot device, but
it can control any secondary SCSI device.
.It
This board has been sold by Iomega as a Jaz Jet PCI adapter.
.It
This board has been sold by SIIG as the i540 SpeedMaster.

.\" For ISA or Vesa Local Bus adapters, one kernel config entry is required
.\" for every card to be attached by the system.  Specific values for the port
.\" address, irq, and drq may be specified.  If wildcard values are used, the
.\" driver will query the device for its current settings and use those.  If
.\" the port address is a wildcard, the driver consults an internal table of
.\" possible port address locations and attaches to the first unattached card
.\" it finds.  The possible port addresses for these card are 0x110, 0x130,
.\" 0x150, 0x190, 0x210, 0x230, 0x250, and 0x330.

Per target configuration performed in the
.Tn AdvanceWare
menu, which is accessible at boot,
is honored by this driver.
This includes synchronous/asynchronous transfers,
maximum synchronous negotiation rate, disconnection, tagged queueing,
and the host adapter's SCSI ID.
The global setting for the maximum number of tagged transactions allowed
per target is not honored as the CAM SCSI system will automatically determine
the maximum number of tags a device can receive as well as guarantee fair
resource allocation among devices.
