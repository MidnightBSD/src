.Sh NAME
.Nm isp
.Nd Qlogic based SCSI and FibreChannel SCSI Host Adapters
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device scbus"
.Cd "device isp"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
isp_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This driver provides access to
.Tn SCSI
or
.Tn FibreChannel
devices.
.Pp
SCSI features include support for Ultra SCSI and wide mode transactions
for
.Tn SCSI ,
Ultra2 LVD (for the ISP1080 and ISP1280), and Ultra3 LVD (for the
ISP12160).
.Pp
Fibre Channel support uses FCP SCSI profile for
.Tn FibreChannel ,
and utilizes Class 3 and Class 2 connections (Qlogic 2100 is Class
3 only, minor patches to the Qlogic 2200 to force Class 2 mode).
Support is available for Public and Private loops, and for
point-to-point connections (Qlogic 2200 only).
The newer 2-Gigabit cards (2300, 2312, 2322) and 4-Gigabit (2422, 2432)
are also supported.
Command tagging is
supported for all (in fact,
.Tn FibreChannel
requires tagging).
Fabric support is enabled by default for other than 2100 cards.
Fabric
support for 2100 cards has been so problematic and these cards are so
old now that it is just not worth your time to try it.
.Sh FIRMWARE
Firmware is available if the
.Xr ispfw 4
module is loaded during bootstrap (q.v.).
.Pp
It is
.Ar strongly
recommended that you use the firmware available
from
.Xr ispfw 4
as it is the most likely to have been tested with this driver.
.Sh HARDWARE

.Nm

.Sh CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
.Pp
Target mode support may be enabled with the
.Pp
.Cd options ISP_TARGET_MODE
.Pp
option.
.Sh BOOT OPTIONS
The following options are switchable by setting values in
.Pa /boot/device.hints .
.Pp
They are:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Va hint.isp.0.disable
A hint value to disable driver in kernel.
.It Va hint.isp.0.fwload_disable
A hint value to disable loading of firmware
.Xr ispfw 4 .
.It Va hint.isp.0.prefer_memmap
A hint value to use PCI memory space instead of I/O space
access for.
.It Va hint.isp.0.prefer_iomap
A hint value to use PCI I/O space instead of Memory space
access for.
.It Va hint.isp.0.ignore_nvram
A hint value to ignore board NVRAM settings for.
Otherwise use NVRAM settings.
.It Va hint.isp.0.fullduplex
A hint value to set full duplex mode.
.It Va hint.isp.0.topology
A hint value to select topology of connection.
Supported values are:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width ".Li lport-only" -compact
.It Li lport
Prefer loopback and fallback to point to point.
.It Li nport
Prefer point to point and fallback to loopback.
.It Li lport-only
Loopback only.
.It Li nport-only
Point to point only.
.El
.It Va hint.isp.0.portwwn
This should be the full 64 bit World Wide Port Name you would like
to use, overriding the value in NVRAM for the card.
.It Va hint.isp.0.nodewwn
This should be the full 64 bit World Wide Node Name you would like
to use, overriding the value in NVRAM for the card.
.It Va hint.isp.0.iid
A hint to override or set the Initiator ID or Loop ID.
For Fibre Channel
cards in Local Loop topologies it is
.Ar strongly
recommended that you set this value to non-zero.
.It Va hint.isp.0.role
A hint to define default role for isp instance (target, initiator, both).
.It Va hint.isp.0.debug
A hint value for a driver debug level (see the file
.Pa /usr/src/sys/dev/isp/ispvar.h
for the values.
.El
.Sh SYSCTL OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Va dev.isp.N.loop_down_limit
This value says how long to wait in seconds after loop has gone down before
giving up and expiring all of the devices that were visible.
The default is 300 seconds (5 minutes).
A separate (nonadjustable) timeout is used when
booting to not stop booting on lack of FC connectivity.
.It Va dev.isp.N.gone_device_time
This value says how long to wait for devices to reappear if they (temporarily)
disappear due to loop or fabric events.
While this timeout is running, I/O
to those devices will simply be held.
.It Va dev.isp.N.wwnn
This is the readonly World Wide Node Name value for this port.
.It Va dev.isp.N.wwpn
This is the readonly World Wide Port Name value for this port.

.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
driver was written by Matthew Jacob originally for NetBSD at
NASA/Ames Research Center.
.Sh BUGS
The driver currently ignores some NVRAM settings.
.Pp
Target mode support is not completely reliable yet.
It works reasonably
well for Fibre Channel, somewhat well for Qlogic 1040 cards, but
does not yet work for the other cards (due to last minute unannounced
changes in firmware interfaces).
