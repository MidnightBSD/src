.Sh NAME
.Nm isp
.Nd Qlogic based SCSI and FibreChannel SCSI Host Adapters
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "device isp"
.Pp
For one or more SCSI busses:
.Cd device scbus0
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This driver provides access to
.Tn SCSI
or
.Tn FibreChannel
devices.
.Pp
SCSI features include support for Ultra SCSI and wide mode transactions
for
.Tn SCSI ,
Ultra2 LVD (for the ISP1080 and ISP1280), and Ultra3 LVD (for the
ISP12160).
.Pp
Fibre Channel support uses FCP SCSI profile for
.Tn FibreChannel .
and utilizes Class 3 and Class 2 connections (Qlogic 2100 is Class
3 only, minor patches to the Qlogic 2200 to force Class 2 mode).
Support is available for Public and Private loops, and for
point-to-point connections (Qlogic 2200 only).
The newer 2-Gigabit cards (2300, 2312) are also supported.
Command tagging is
supported for all (in fact,
.Tn FibreChannel
requires tagging).
Fabric support is enabled by default (but may
be contingent upon the correct firmware being loaded).
.Sh FIRMWARE
Firmware is now available if the
.Xr ispfw 4
module is loaded during bootstrap (q.v.).
.Pp
It is very strongly recommended that you use the firmware available
from
.Xr ispfw 4
as it is the most likely to have been tested with this driver.
.Sh HARDWARE

.Nm
driver include:

.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
driver was written by Matthew Jacob for NASA/Ames Research Center.
.Sh BUGS
The driver currently ignores some NVRAM settings.
.Pp
The driver currently does not do error recovery for timed out commands
very gracefully.
.Pp
Target mode support is not completely debugged yet.
It works reasonably
well for Fibre Channel, somewhat well for Qlogic 1040 cards, but
does not yet work for the other cards (due to last minute unannounced
changes in firmware interfaces).
.Pp
Sometimes, when booting, the driver gets stuck waiting for the
Fibre Channel f/w to tell it that the loop port database is ready,
or waiting for a good loop to be seen (this does not yet support
booting without being connected to a fibre channel device).
To
unwedge the system, unplug and replug the fibre channel connection,
or otherwise cause a LIP (Loop Initialization Primitive sequence)-
this will kick the f/w into getting unstuck.
