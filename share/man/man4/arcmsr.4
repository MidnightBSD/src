.Sh NAME
.Nm arcmsr
.Nd Areca SATA II RAID Controller driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "device arcmsr"
.Cd "device pci"
.Cd "device scbus"
.Cd "device da"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the Areca ARC-11xx and ARC-12xx series of SATA II
RAID controllers.
These controllers feature RAID-0, 1, 3, 5, 6, and 10 and
JBOD acceleration for up to 16 SATA drives.
Raid level and stripe level
migration, online capacity expansion, hot insertion/removal, automatic failover
and rebuild, and SMART are also supported.
Access to the arrays is provided
via the SCSI CAM
.Pa /dev/da?
device nodes.
A management interface is also present via the
.Pa /dev/arcmsr?
device node.
Management tools for i386 and amd64 are available from Areca.

driver first appeared in
.Fx 5.4 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The driver was written by
.An Erich Chen Aq erich@areca.com.tw .
.Sh BUGS
The driver has been tested on i386 and amd64.
It likely requires additional
work to function on big-endian architectures.
