.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm gem
.Nd ERI/GEM/GMAC Ethernet device driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "device miibus"
.Cd "device gem"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the GMac Ethernet hardware found mostly in
the last Apple PowerBooks G3s and most G4-based Apple hardware, as
well as many Sun UltraSPARCs.
.Sh HARDWARE
.Pp
Cards supported by
.Nm
driver include:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
Sun GEM gigabit Ethernet
.It
Sun ERI 10/100 Mbps Ethernet
.It
Apple GMAC
.El
.Sh NOTES
On sparc64 the
.Nm
driver respects the
.Va local-mac-address?
system configuration variable which can be set in the Open Firmware boot
monitor using the
.Ic setenv
command or by
.Xr eeprom 8 .
If set to
.Dq Li false
(the default), the
.Nm
driver will use the system's default MAC address for all of its devices.
If set to
.Dq Li true ,
the unique MAC address of each interface is used if present rather than
the system's default MAC address.
.Pp
Supported interfaces having their own MAC address include the on-board
Sun ERI 10/100 Mbps and GEM gigabit Ethernet Interfaces on boards equipped
with more than one Ethernet interface and the Sun GEM gigabit Ethernet
add-on cards.
