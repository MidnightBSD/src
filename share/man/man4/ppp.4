.Sh NAME
.Nm ppp
.Nd point to point protocol network interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "device ppp"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
interface allows serial lines to be used as network interfaces using the
.Em point-to-point
protocol.
The
.Nm
interface can use various types of compression and has many features over
the
.Xr sl 4
protocol.
.Pp
Each
.Nm
interface is created at runtime using interface cloning.
This is most easily done with the
.Xr ifconfig 8
.Cm create
command or using the
.Va cloned_interfaces
variable in
.Xr rc.conf 5 .
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It ppp%d: af%d not supported.
The interface was handed
a message with addresses formatted in an unsuitable address
family; the packet was dropped.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr inet 4 ,
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr sl 4 ,
.Xr pppd 8 ,
.Xr pppstats 8
.Sh BUGS
Currently, only the
.Xr ip 4
protocol is supported.
