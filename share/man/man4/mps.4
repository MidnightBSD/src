.Sh NAME
.Nm mps
.Nd LSI Fusion-MPT 2 Serial Attached SCSI driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into your kernel,
place the following lines in your kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device scbus"
.Cd "device mps"
.Ed
.Pp
Or, to load the driver as a module at boot, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
mps_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for LSI Logic Fusion-MPT 2
.Tn SAS
controllers and WarpDrive solid state storage cards.
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
driver supports the following controllers:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
LSI Logic SAS2004 (4 Port
.Tn SAS )
.It
LSI Logic SAS2008 (8 Port
.Tn SAS )
.It
LSI Logic SAS2108 (8 Port
.Tn SAS )
.It
LSI Logic SAS2116 (16 Port
.Tn SAS )
.It
LSI Logic SAS2208 (8 Port
.Tn SAS )
.El
.Sh CONFIGURATION
To disable MSI interrupts for all
.Nm
driver instances, set the following tunable value in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
hw.mps.disable_msi=1
.Ed
.Pp
To disable MSI interrupts for a specific
.Nm
driver instance, set the following tunable value in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
dev.mps.X.disable_msi=1
.Ed
.Pp
where X is the adapter number.
.Pp
To disable MSI-X interrupts for all
.Nm
driver instances, set the following tunable value in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
hw.mps.disable_msix=1
.Ed
.Pp
To disable MSI-X interrupts for a specific
.Nm
driver instance, set the following tunable value in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
dev.mps.X.disable_msix=1
.Ed
.Pp
To set the maximum number of DMA chains allocated for all adapters,
set the following variable in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
hw.mps.max_chains=NNNN
.Ed
.Pp
To set the maximum number of DMA chains allocated for a specific adapter,
set the following variable in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
dev.mps.X.max_chains=NNNN
.Ed
.Pp
This variable may also be viewed via
.Xr sysctl 8
to see the maximum set for a given adapter.
.Pp
The current number of free chain frames may be seen via the
dev.mps.X.chain_free
.Xr sysctl 8
variable.
.Pp
The lowest number of free chain frames may be seen via the
dev.mps.X.chain_free_lowwater
.Xr sysctl 8
variable.
.Pp
The current number of active I/O commands is shown in the
dev.mps.X.io_cmds_active
.Xr sysctl 8
variable.
.Pp
The maximum number of active I/O command seen since boot is shown in the
dev.mps.X.io_cmds_highwater
.Xr sysctl 8
variable.
.Sh DEBUGGING
To enable debugging prints from the
.Nm
driver, set the
.Bd -literal -offset indent
hw.mps.X.debug_level
.Ed
.Pp
variable, where X is the adapter number, either in
.Xr loader.conf 5
or via
.Xr sysctl 8 .
The following bits have the described effects:
.Bl -tag -offset indent
.It 0x01
Enable informational prints.
.It 0x02
Enable tracing prints.
.It 0x04
Enable prints for driver faults.
.It 0x08
Enable prints for controller events.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Fx 9.0 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
driver was originally written by
.An Scott Long Aq scottl@FreeBSD.org .
It has been improved and tested by LSI Logic Corporation.
This man page was written by
.An Ken Merry Aq ken@FreeBSD.org .
.Sh BUGS
This driver has a couple of known shortcomings:
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
No userland utility available (e.g.
.Xr mptutil 8 ) .
.It
The driver probes devices sequentially.
If your system has a large number of devices, the probe will take a while.
