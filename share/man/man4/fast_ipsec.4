.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Tn IPsec
is a set of protocols,
.Tn ESP
(for Encapsulating Security Payload)
.Tn AH
(for Authentication Header),
and
.Tn IPComp
(for IP Payload Compression Protocol)
that provide security services for IP datagrams.
.Nm
is an experimental implementation of these protocols that uses the
.Xr crypto 4
subsystem to carry out cryptographic operations.
This means, in particular, that cryptographic hardware devices are
employed whenever possible to optimize the performance of these protocols.
.Pp
In general, the
.Nm
implementation is intended to be compatible with the
.Tn KAME IPsec
implementation.
This documentation concentrates on differences from that software.
The user should refer to
.Xr ipsec 4
for basic information on setting up and using these protocols.
.Pp
System configuration requires the
.Xr crypto 4
subsystem.
When the
.Nm
protocols are configured for use, all protocols are included in the system.
To selectively enable/disable protocols, use
.Xr sysctl 8 .
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
To be added.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr crypto 4 ,
.Xr ipsec 4 ,
.Xr setkey 8 ,
.Xr sysctl 8
.Sh HISTORY
The protocols draw heavily on the
.Ox
implementation of the
.Tn IPsec
protocols.
The policy management code is derived from the
.Tn KAME
implementation found
in their
.Tn IPsec
protocols.
The
.Nm
protocols first appeared in
.Fx 5.0 .
.Sh BUGS
There is presently no support for IPv6.
.Pp
The
.Tn IPcomp
protocol support does not work.
.Pp
Certain legacy authentication algorithms are not supported because of
issues with the
.Xr crypto 4
subsystem.
.Pp
This documentation is incomplete.
