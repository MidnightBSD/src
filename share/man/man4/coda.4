.Sh NAME
.Nm coda 
.Nd Coda Distributed File System
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "options CODA"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
coda_load="YES"
.Ed
.Pp
To load as a kernel loadable module after boot:
.Pp
.Dl "kldload coda"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
kernel module allows the experimental, third-party Coda distributed file
system client to be used with
.Fx .
The module allows the userspace Coda client daemon, Venus, to present the
Coda distributed file system namespace via the local
.Pa /coda
file system mountpoint via the
.Pa /dev/cfs0
special device.
.Pp
To use Coda, the Coda client software package must also be installed; more
information on Coda may be found in the Coda documentation distributed with
that package.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr loader.conf 5 ,
.Xr kldload 8
.Sh HISTORY
Support for
.Nm
first appeared in
.Fx 3.0 .

.Sh BUGS
The
Coda distributed file system is considered experimental, and production
deployment should occur only after careful consideration of the risks of
deploying experimental software.
