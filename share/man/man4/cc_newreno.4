.Sh ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
Development and testing of this software were made possible in part by grants
from the FreeBSD Foundation and Cisco University Research Program Fund at
Community Foundation Silicon Valley.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
congestion control algorithm first appeared in its modular form in
.Fx 9.0 .
.Pp
The module was first released in 2007 by James Healy and Lawrence Stewart whilst
working on the NewTCP research project at Swinburne University of Technology's
Centre for Advanced Internet Architectures, Melbourne, Australia, which was made
possible in part by a grant from the Cisco University Research Program Fund at
Community Foundation Silicon Valley.
