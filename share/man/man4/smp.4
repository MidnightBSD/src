.Sh NAME
.Nm SMP
.Nd description of the FreeBSD Symmetric Multi-Processor kernel
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd options SMP
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
kernel implements symmetric multi-processor support.
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
Support for multi-processor systems is present for all Tier-1
architectures on
.Fx .
Currently, this includes amd64, i386, ia64, and sparc64.
Support is enabled using
.Cd options SMP .
It is permissible to use the SMP kernel configuration on non-SMP equipped
motherboards.
.Sh I386 NOTES
For i386 systems, the
.Nm
kernel supports motherboards that follow the Intel MP specification,
version 1.4.
In addition to
.Cd options SMP ,
i386 also requires
.Cd device apic .
The
.Xr mptable 1
command may be used to view the status of multi-processor support.
.Pp
The number of CPUs detected by the system is available in
the read-only sysctl variable
.Va hw.ncpu .
.Pp
.Fx
allows specific CPUs on a multi-processor system to be disabled.
The sysctl variable
.Va machdep.hlt_cpus
is an integer bitmask denoting CPUs to halt, counting from 0.
Setting a bit to 1 will result in the corresponding CPU being
disabled.
.Pp
.Fx
supports hyperthreading on Intel CPU's on the i386 platform.
Since using logical CPUs can cause performance penalties under certain loads,
the logical CPUs can be disabled by setting the
.Va machdep.hlt_logical_cpus
sysctl to one.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
kernel's early history is not (properly) recorded.
It was developed
in a separate CVS branch until April 26, 1997, at which point it was
merged into 3.0-current.
By this date 3.0-current had already been
merged with Lite2 kernel code.
.Pp
.Fx 5.0
introduced support for a host of new synchronization primitives, and
a move towards fine-grained kernel locking rather than reliance on
a Giant kernel lock.
The SMPng Project relied heavily on the support of BSDi, who provided
reference source code from the fine-grained SMP implementation found
in
.Bsx .
.Pp
.Fx 5.0
also introduced support for SMP on the ia64 and sparc64 architectures.
