.Dt ENC 4
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm enc
.Nd Encapsulating Interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following line in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device enc"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
interface is a software loopback mechanism that allows hosts or
firewalls to filter
.Xr ipsec 4
traffic using any firewall package that hooks in via the
.Xr pfil 9
framework.
.Pp
The
.Nm
interface allows an administrator
to see outgoing packets before they have been processed by
.Xr ipsec 4 ,
or incoming packets after they have been similarly processed, via
.Xr tcpdump 1 .
.Pp
The
.Dq Li enc0
interface inherits all IPsec traffic.
Thus all IPsec traffic can be filtered based on
.Dq Li enc0 ,
and all IPsec traffic could be seen by invoking
.Xr tcpdump 1
on the
.Dq Li enc0
interface.
.Sh EXAMPLES
To see all outgoing packets before they have been processed via
.Xr ipsec 4 ,
or all incoming packets after they have been similarly processed:
.Pp
.Dl "tcpdump -i enc0"
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr tcpdump 1 ,
.Xr bpf 4 ,
.Xr ipf 4 ,
.Xr ipfw 4 ,
.Xr ipsec 4 ,
.Xr pf 4 ,
.Xr tcpdump 8
