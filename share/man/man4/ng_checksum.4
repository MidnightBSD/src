.Dt NG_CHECKSUM 4
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm ng_checksum
.Nd IP checksum node type
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In netgraph/ng_checksum.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm checksum
node can calculate and prepare for calculation in hardware
IPv4 header, TCP, UDP checksum.
.Sh HOOKS
This node type has two hooks:
.Bl -tag -width ".Va out"
.It Va in
Packets received on this hook are processed according to settings specified
in config and then forwarded to
.Ar out
hook, if it exists and connected. Otherwise they are reflected back to the
.Ar in
hook.
.It Va out
Packets received on this hook are forwarded to
.Ar in
hook without any changes.
.El
.Sh CONTROL MESSAGES
This node type supports the generic control messages, plus the following:
.Bl -tag -width foo
.It Dv NGM_CHECKSUM_SETDLT Pq Ic setdlt
Sets data link type on the
.Va in
hook. Currently, supported types are
.Cm DLT_RAW
(raw IP datagrams) and
.Cm DLT_EN10MB
(Ethernet). DLT_ definitions can be found in
.In net/bpf.h
header. Currently used values are
.Cm DLT_EN10MB
= 1 and
.Cm DLT_RAW
= 12.
.It Dv NGM_CHECKSUM_GETDLT Pq Ic getdlt
This control message obtains data link type on the
.Va in
hook.
.It Dv NGM_CHECKSUM_SETCONFIG Pq Ic setconfig
Sets node configuration. The following
.Vt "struct ng_checksum_config"
must be supplied as an argument:
.Bd -literal -offset 4n
struct ng_checksum_config {
	uint64_t	csum_flags;
	uint64_t	csum_offload;
};
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Va csum_flags
can be set to any combination of CSUM_IP, CSUM_TCP, CSUM_UDP, CSUM_TCP_IPV6 and CSUM_UDP_IPV6
(other values are ignored) for instructing node need calculate the corresponding checksum.
.Pp
The
.Va csum_offload
can be set to any combination of CSUM_IP, CSUM_TCP, CSUM_UDP, CSUM_TCP_IPV6 and CSUM_UDP_IPV6
(other values are ignored) for instructing node what checksum can calculate in hardware.
.Pp
Also processed any combination of CSUM_IP, CSUM_TCP, CSUM_UDP, CSUM_TCP_IPV6 and CSUM_UDP_IPV6 sets before on mbuf.
.It Dv NGM_CHECKSUM_GETCONFIG Pq Ic getconfig
This control message obtains current node configuration,
returned as
.Vt "struct ng_checksum_config" .
.It Dv NGM_CHECKSUM_GET_STATS Pq Ic getstats
Returns node statistics as a
.Vt "struct ng_checksum_stats" .
.It Dv NGM_CHECKSUM_CLR_STATS Pq Ic clrstats
Clear node statistics.
.It Dv NGM_CHECKSUM_GETCLR_STATS Pq Ic getclrstats
This command is identical to
.Dv NGM_CHECKSUM_GET_STATS ,
except that the statistics are also atomically cleared.
.El
.Sh SHUTDOWN
This node shuts down upon receipt of a
.Dv NGM_SHUTDOWN
control message, or when all hooks have been disconnected.
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Xr ngctl 8
script:
.Bd -literal -offset 4n
/usr/sbin/ngctl -f- <<-SEQ
	msg checksum-1: "setdlt 1"
	ngctl msg checksum-1: "setconfig { csum_flags=0 csum_offload=6 }"
.Ed
.Pp
Set data link type to
.Cm DLT_EN10MB
(Ethernet), not set additional checksum flags, set hardware
can calculate CSUM_IP_UDP|CSUM_IP_TCP.

The
.Nm
node type was implemented in
.Fx 10.2 
and first submitted in 
.Fx 12.0 .
