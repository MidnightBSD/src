.Sh NAME
.Nm ahb
.Nd Adaptec EISA SCSI host adapter driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd device ahb
.Cd device scbus
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This driver provides access to the
.Tn SCSI
bus connected to an Adaptec
AHA-174X host adapters in
.Dq Em enhanced
mode.
Tagged queueing and synchronous SCSI transfers are supported.
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
driver supports the following SCSI host adapters:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
Adaptec AHA-1740
.It
Adaptec AHA-1742
.It
Adaptec AHA-1740A
.It
Adaptec AHA-1742A
.El
.Sh CAVEATS
The Adaptec 174X is very sensitive to SCSI bus termination and cable
length.
It may also have difficulties operating with some modern devices
that, due to their speed, expose timing problems in the controller.
There are no known mechanisms for working around device incompatibilities of
this nature.
