.Sh NAME
.Nm urtwnfw
.Nd "Firmware Module for Realtek Wireless driver"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this module into the kernel,
place the following line in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device urtwnfw"
.Ed
.Pp
This will include three firmware images inside the kernel.
If you want to pick only the firmware image for your network adapter choose one
of the following:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device urtwn-rtl8192cfwT"
.Cd "device urtwn-rtl8192cfwU"
.Cd "device urtwn-rtl8188eufw"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
urtwn-rtl8192cfwT_load="YES"
urtwn-rtl8192cfwU_load="YES"
urtwn-rtl8188eufw_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This module provides access to firmware sets for the
Realtek RTL8188CUS, RTL8188CE-VAU, RTL8188EUS, RTL8188RU and RTL8192CU
chip based USB WiFi adapters.
It may be
statically linked into the kernel, or loaded as a module.
.Pp
For the loaded firmware to be enabled for use the license at
.Pa /usr/share/doc/legal/realtek.LICENSE
must be agreed to by adding the following line to
