.Sh NAME
.Nm asr
.Nd driver for Adaptec I2O based SCSI/ATA host bus adapters
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "device asr"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The Adaptec
.Nm
driver provides access to disks
and disk arrays controlled by I2O based host bus adapters and
SmartRAID SCSI RAID adapters through the standard SCSI disk
.Xr da 4
interface.
.Pp
The supported adapters provide 64 bit PCI,
Compact PCI, Zero Channel PCI,
and up to four channels of Ultra2, Ultra 160, or Ultra320 SCSI,
or two channels of 1GB Fibre.
All support RAID-0, RAID-1, RAID-10, RAID-5 and RAID-50 arrays.
All SCSI target types are supported.
For the ATA based controllers, one IDE drive per channel is supported.
Hot-swapping of IDE drives is not supported at this time.
.Pp
All host bus adapters must be configured
before they can be used with any operating system.
Please contact Adaptec directly to obtain the latest information
on configuration utilities for the adapters.
Currently there are both a Motif based GUI configuration utility
and a CLI based configuration utility available from the Adaptec Web site.
The cards and arrays can also be configured via the BIOS based configuration
tool (SMOR).

.Sh NOTES
The ATA based controllers present their devices as SCSI-like devices via CAM.
For IDE drives attached to these cards, a subset of standard SCSI commands
and mode pages are understood via translation performed in the card's firmware.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
(Adaptec SCSI RAID)
driver first appeared as the dpti2o driver under BSDi
.Bsx 3.2 ,
then under
.Fx 2.2.8
and was ported over to the CAM layer represented in 4.0.
