.Sh NAME
.Nm adw
.Nd Advansys PCI 16bit SCSI Host adapter driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device pci"
.Cd "device scbus"
.Cd "device adw"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This driver provides access to the 16bit
.Tn SCSI
bus connected to the Advanced Systems Products, Inc.
.Tn ASC3550 Ultra ,
and
.Tn ASC38C0800 Ultra2 ,
SCSI Host Adapter chips.
Both chips support, synchronous transfers
(20MHz and 40MHz max respectively),
16bit transfers, tagged queueing,
and up to 253 concurrent SCSI transactions.
.Pp
Per target configuration performed in the
.Tn AdvanceWare
menu, which is accessible at boot,
is honored by this driver.
This includes synchronous/asynchronous transfers,
maximum synchronous negotiation rate, wide transfers, disconnection,
tagged queueing, and the host adapter's SCSI ID.
The global setting for the maximum number of tagged transactions allowed
per target is not honored as the CAM SCSI system will automatically determine
the maximum number of tags a device can receive as well as guarantee fair
resource allocation among devices.
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
driver supports SCSI controllers including:

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver appeared in

.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
driver was ported by
.An Justin T. Gibbs
from the Linux driver written by
.An Bob Frey
of Advanced System Products, Inc.
Many thanks to AdvanSys for providing the original driver
under a suitable license for use in
.Fx .
