.Sh NAME
.Nm vpo
.Nd parallel to SCSI interface driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "device vpo"
.Pp
For one or more SCSI busses:
.Cd "device scbus"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provide access to parallel port Iomega Zip and Jaz drives.
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
driver supports the following parallel to SCSI interfaces:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
Adaptec AIC-7110 Parallel to SCSI interface (built-in to Iomega ZIP
drives)
.It
Iomega Jaz Traveller interface
.It
Iomega MatchMaker SCSI interface (built-in to Iomega ZIP+ drives)
.El
.Sh USAGE
The driver should let you use a printer connected to the drive while
transferring data.
.Pp
DOS and
.Fx
file systems are supported.
When mounting a DOS file system or
formatting a
.Fx
file system, check the slice of the disk with the
.Xr fdisk 8
utility.
.Pp
In order to unixify a ZIP disk, put the following in /etc/disktab:
.Bd -literal
zip|zip 100:\\
        :ty=removable:se#512:nc#96:nt#64:ns#32:\\
        :pa#196608:oa#0:ba#4096:fa#512:\\
        :pb#196608:ob#0:bb#4096:fb#512:\\
        :pc#196608:oc#0:bc#4096:fc#512:
.Ed
.Pp
and use
.Xr bsdlabel 8 .
.Pp
If you have trouble with your driver, your parallel chipset may not run
properly at the detected mode (NIBBLE, PS2 or EPP).
Tune the
.Xr ppc 4
bootflags to force other modes.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
manual page first appeared in
.Fx 3.0 .
.Sh AUTHORS
This
manual page was written by
.An Nicolas Souchu .
.Sh BUGS
During boot, the driver first tries to detect a classic ZIP, then a ZIP+.
The ZIP+ detection is intrusive and may send erroneous characters to your
printer if the drive is not connected to your parallel port.
