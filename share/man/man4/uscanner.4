.Dt USCANNER 4
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm uscanner
.Nd USB Scanners
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following line in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device uscanner"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
uscanner_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for scanners that attach to the USB port.
For each scanner attached it will provide an entry like
.Pa /dev/uscanner0
in
.Pa /dev .
User-space programs, e.g. SANE,
can in turn use the device entry throgh a suitable
backend driver (see
.Nm ports/graphics/sane-backends )
to control the scanner itself.
.Pp
In case of multifunction USB devices (e.g. scanner/printer/card reader),
this driver only attaches to the USB interface that controls
the scanner; for the other USB interface you need separate drivers, e.g.
.Nm ulpt ,
.Nm umass ,
and so on.
.Pp
.Nm usb
and one of
.Nm uhci
or
.Nm ohci
must be configured in the kernel as well.
.Sh HARDWARE
Because there is no standard device class for USB scanners, this driver
will only recognise devices whose USB IDs are explicitly listed in the
table in the driver itself.
.Pp
The following devices are supported to date:
