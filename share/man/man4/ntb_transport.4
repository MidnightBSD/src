.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ntb_transport_load="YES"
.Ed
.Pp
The following tunables are settable from the
.Xr loader 8 :
.Bl -ohang
.It Va hw.ntb_transport.debug_level
Driver debug level.
The default value is 0, higher means more verbose.
.It Va hint.ntb_transport. Ns Ar X Ns Va .config

Each device can be configured as: "<name>[:<queues>]", where:
.Va name
is a name of the driver which should attach the device (empty means any),
.Va queues
is a number of queues to allocate (empty means automatic),
The default configuration is empty string, which means single device
with one queue per memory window allowing any driver attachment.

driver to utilize its resources to create set of bidirectional queues,
delivering packets between the systems.
The primary purpose of this is to be used by
.Nm if_ntb
network interface, but other consumers may also be developed using KPI.
