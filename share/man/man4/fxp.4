.Sh NAME
.Nm fxp
.Nd "Intel EtherExpress PRO/100 Ethernet device driver"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device miibus"
.Cd "device fxp"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
if_fxp_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for Ethernet adapters based on the Intel
i82557, i82558, i82559, i82550, and i82562 chips.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media types:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
.It autoselect
Enable autoselection of the media type and options
.It 10baseT/UTP
Set 10Mbps operation
.It 100baseTX
Set 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) operation
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media options:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
.It full-duplex
Set full duplex operation
.El
.Pp
Note that 100baseTX media type is not available on the Pro/10.
For further information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports reception and transmission of extended frames
for
.Xr vlan 4 .
This capability of
.Nm
can be controlled by means of the
.Cm vlanmtu
parameter
to
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver also supports a special link option:
.Bl -tag -width link0
.It Cm link0
Some chip revisions have loadable microcode which can be used to reduce the
interrupt load on the host cpu.
Not all boards have microcode support.
Setting the
.Cm link0
flag with
.Xr ifconfig 8
will download the microcode to the chip if it is available.
.El

.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "fxp%d: couldn't map memory"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "fxp%d: couldn't map interrupt"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "fxp%d: Failed to malloc memory"
There are not enough mbuf's available for allocation.
.It "fxp%d: device timeout"
The device has stopped responding to the network, or there is a problem with
the network connection (cable).
.It "fxp%d: Microcode loaded, int_delay: %d usec  bundle_max: %d"
The chip has successfully downloaded the microcode, and changed the
parameterized values to the given settings.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver first appeared in
.Fx 2.1 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
device driver was written by
.An David Greenman .
It has then been updated to use the busdma API and made endian-clean by
.An Maxime Henrion .
