.Sh NAME
.Nm snd_via8233
.Nd "VIA Technologies VT8233 bridge device driver"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "device sound"
.Cd "device snd_via8233"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
bridge driver allows the generic audio driver,
.Xr sound 4 ,
to attach to the VIA VT8233 audio devices.
These audio chipsets are integrated in the southbridge on many VIA based
motherboards.
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
driver supports the following audio chipsets:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
VIA VT8233
.It
VIA VT8233A
.It
VIA VT8233C
.It
VIA VT8235
.It
VIA VT8237
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr sound 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver first appeared in
.Fx 4.7 .
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
driver
does not support S/PDIF.
There is partial support in the code, so implementing it should be fairly
easy if the right hardware is available.
