.Sh NAME
.Nm stg
.Nd driver for Future Domain based SCSI controllers
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device scbus"
.Cd "device stg"
.Pp
For one or more ISA cards:
.Cd "device isa"
.Pp
In
.Pa /boot/device.hints :
.Cd hint.stg.0.at="isa"
.Pp
For one or more PCI cards:
.Cd "device pci"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
stg_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for ISA, PCCARD and PCI controllers based on
Future Domain SCSI controller chips including the TMC-16C30, 16C50 and 32C60.
.Sh HARDWARE
