.Sh NAME
.Nm udbp
.Nd USB Double Bulk Pipe driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following line in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device udbp"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
udbp_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for host-to-host cables
that contain at least two bulk pipes (one for each direction),
for example
the EzLink cable and the NetChip 1080 chip.
.Pp
.\" XXX	The description of how to add netgraph to the kernel
.\"	is out of place here.  It should be limited to the
.\"	netgraph(4) manpage only.  However, that page does
.\"	not yet give instructions for kldload(8) for the
.\"	clueless.  Working on it -- sheldonh
It requires
.Xr netgraph 4
to be available.
This can be done either by adding
.Cd "options NETGRAPH"
to your kernel configuration file, or alternatively loading
.Xr netgraph 4
as a module, either from
.Pa /boot/loader.conf
or from the command line, before the
.Nm
module.
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Dl options NETGRAPH
.Dl device udbp
.Pp
Add the
.Nm
driver to the kernel.
.Pp
.Dl kldload netgraph
.Dl kldload udbp
.Pp
Load the
.Xr netgraph 4
module and then the
.Nm
driver.
.Pp
.Dl ngctl mkpeer udbp0: iface data inet
.Dl ifconfig ng0 10.0.0.1 10.0.0.2
.Pp
Create a new network interface node
and connect its inet hook to the data hook of the
.Nm
node.
.Xr ifconfig 8
configures the resulting network interface ng0 with a local
IP address of 10.0.0.1 and a remote IP address of 10.0.0.2.
On the remote host, the two
IP addresses should of course be reversed.
