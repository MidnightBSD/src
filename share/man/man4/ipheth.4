.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Hans Petter Selasky Aq Mt hselasky@FreeBSD.org .
.Sh BUGS
Some devices may need to be manually configured to use an alternative
configuration with the
.Xr usbconfig 8
utility.
A command similar to
.Dl usbconfig -u 1 -a 2 set_config 3
may be required if the device is not recognised automatically by
.Nm
after it is connected.
