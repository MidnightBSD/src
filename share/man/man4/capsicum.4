.Sh NAME
.Nm Capsicum
.Nd lightweight OS capability and sandbox framework
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "options CAPABILITY_MODE"
.Cd "options CAPABILITIES"
.Cd "options PROCDESC"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a lightweight OS capability and sandbox framework implementing a hybrid
capability system model.
.Nm
can be used for application and library compartmentalisation, the
decomposition of larger bodies of software into isolated (sandboxed)
components in order to implement security policies and limit the impact of
software vulnerabilities.
.Pp
.Nm
provides two core kernel primitives:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It capability mode
A process mode, entered by invoking
.Xr cap_enter 2 ,
in which access to global OS namespaces (such as the file system and PID
namespaces) is restricted; only explicitly delegated rights, referenced by
memory mappings or file descriptors, may be used.
Once set, the flag is inherited by future children processes, and may not be
cleared.
.It capabilities
File descriptors that wrap other file descriptors, masking operations that can
be called on them; for example, a file descriptor returned by
.Xr open 2
may be refined using
.Xr cap_new 2
so that only
.Xr read 2
and
.Xr write 2
can be called, but not
.Xr fchmod 2 .
.El
.Pp
In some cases,
.Nm
requires use of alternatives to traditional POSIX APIs in order to name
objects using capabilities rather than global namespaces:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It process descriptors
File descriptors representing processes, allowing parent processes to manage
child processes without requiring access to the PID namespace.
.It anonymous shared memory
An extension to the POSIX shared memory API to support anonymous swap objects
associated with file descriptors.
