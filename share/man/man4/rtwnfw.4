To compile this module into the kernel,
place the following line in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device rtwnfw"
.Ed
.Pp
This will include three firmware images inside the kernel.
If you want to pick only the firmware image for your network adapter choose one
of the following:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device rtwn-rtl8192cfwU"
.Cd "device rtwn-rtl8192cfwU_B"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
rtwn-rtl8192cfwU_load="YES"
rtwn-rtl8192cfwU_B_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This module provides access to firmware sets for the
Realtek RTL8188CE chip based PCIe adapters.
