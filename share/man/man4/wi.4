.Sh NAME
.Nm wi
.Nd "Lucent Hermes, Intersil PRISM and Spectrum24 IEEE 802.11 driver"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device wi"
.Cd "device wlan"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
if_wi_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for wireless network adapters based around
the Lucent Hermes, Intersil PRISM-II, Intersil PRISM-2.5, Intersil
Prism-3, and Symbol Spectrum24 chipsets.
All five chipsets provide a similar interface to the driver.
.Pp
Supported features include 802.11 and 802.3 frames, power management, BSS,
IBSS, WDS and old-style Lucent ad-hoc operation modes.
Cards based on the Intersil PRISM chips also support a host-based
access point mode which allows a card to act as a normal access point
(with some assistance from the
.Nm
driver).
The Lucent Hermes and Symbol Spectrum24 chipsets do not contain this
functionality.
The PRISM family of chips do not support the WDS functionality.
All host/device interaction is via programmed I/O, even on those cards
that support a DMA interface.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver encapsulates all IP and ARP traffic as 802.11 frames, however
it can receive either 802.11 or 802.3 frames.
Transmit speed is selectable between 1Mbps, 2Mbps, 5.5 Mbps and 11Mbps
depending on your hardware.
Most hardware supports 11Mbps where the signal quality allows, but
falls back to slower speeds when it does not.
Except for the Lucent WaveLAN Bronze cards, all cards supported by the
.Nm
driver support WEP for encryption.
To enable encryption, use
.Xr ifconfig 8
as shown below.
.Pp
By default, the
.Nm
driver configures the card for BSS operation (aka infrastructure
mode).
This mode requires the use of an access point (base station).
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver also supports a point-to-point mode
where stations can communicate amongst themselves without the
aid of an access point.
Note that there are two possible point-to-point modes.
One mode, referred to as
.Dq "ad-hoc demo mode" ,
or
.Dq "legacy Lucent ad-hoc mode" ,
predates the IEEE 802.11 specification and so may not interoperate
with cards from different vendors.
The standardized point-to-point mode is called IBSS (or confusingly
just ad-hoc mode), but is not supported by cards with very old
firmware revisions.
If your cards supports IBSS mode, it is recommended that you use it in
preference to the
.Dq "ad-hoc demo mode"
in new installations.
.Pp
Cards supported by the driver based on the Intersil PRISM family of chips also
have a host-based access point mode which allows the card to
act as an access point (base station).
Access points are different than operating in IBSS mode.
They operate in BSS mode.
They allow for easier roaming and bridge all Ethernet traffic such
that machines connected via an access point appear to be on the local
Ethernet segment.
.Pp
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Pp
Cards supported by the
.Nm
driver come in a variety of packages, though the most common
are of the PCMCIA type.
In many cases, the PCI version of a wireless card is simply
a PCMCIA card bundled with a PCI adapter.
The PCI adapters come in two flavors: true PCMCIA bridges and
dumb PCMCIA bridges.
A true PCMCIA bridge (such as those sold by Lucent) will attach
as a real PCMCIA controller.
The wireless card will then attach to the PCMCIA bus.
Wireless cards in PCMCIA slots may be inserted and ejected on the fly.
.Pp
A dumb bridge, on the other hand, does not show up as a true PCMCIA bus.
The wireless card will simply appear to the host as a normal PCI
device and will not require any PCMCIA support.
Cards in this type of adapter should only be removed when the
machine is powered down.
.Pp
The following cards are among those supported by the
.Nm
driver:

.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "wi%d: init failed"
The WaveLAN card failed to become ready after an initialization command
was issued.
.It "wi%d: failed to allocate %d bytes on NIC"
The driver was unable to allocate memory for transmit frames in the
NIC's on-board RAM.
This can also be an indication of an incorrectly configured interrupt.
.It "wi%d: device timeout"
The WaveLAN card failed to generate an interrupt to acknowledge a transmit
command.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver first appeared in
.Fx 3.0 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Bill Paul Aq wpaul@ctr.columbia.edu .
This man page comes from
.Ox .
.Sh CAVEATS
Different regulatory domains have different default channels for adhoc
mode.
See
.Xr ifconfig 8
for information on how to change the channel.
The Intersil Prism family of chips' host-based access point mode has
bugs for station firmware versions prior to 0.8.3.
The driver currently precludes hostap functionality with older station
firmware.
The best version of the station firmware for the Prism family of chips
seems to be 1.4.9.
Some users of Prism-II and 2.5 based cards report that station firmware
version 1.3.4 works better for them in hostap than 1.4.9.
Older versions of the Prism station firmware have a number of issues
with hostap mode.
The IBSS/adhoc mode appears to work well on station firmware 1.3.1 and
later.
The IBSS/adhoc mode appears to have problems for some people with
older versions of station firmware.
.Pp
Lucent cards prior to firmware version 6.0.6 do not support IBSS
mode.
These cards support only the pre-802.11 mode known as
.Dq "demo ad-hoc mode"
which does not interoperate with stations in IBSS mode.
.Pp
Prism cards prior to version 0.8.0 do not support IBSS mode.
.Pp
Symbol cards prior to version 2.50.00 do not support IBSS mode.
.Sh BUGS
Not all the new messages are documented here, and many of them are
indications of transient errors that are not indications of serious
problems.
.Pp
WL200 PCI wireless cards are based on a Cirrus Logic CL-PD6729 bridge
chips glued to an Intersil Prism-II PCMCIA chipset w/o the PC Card
form factor being present.
These chips are special and require special care to use properly.
One must set
.Va hw.pcic.pd6729_intr_path Ns = Ns Qq Li 2
in
.Pa /boot/loader.conf .
This tells the PC Card system to use PCI interrupts for this odd beast.
It is not possible to know automatically which kind of interrupts to use.
OLDCARD devices
support this device.
NEWCARD devices
.Xr ( pccbb 4
and
.Xr pccard 4 )
do not support it at this time.
