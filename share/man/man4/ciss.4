.Sh NAME
.Nm ciss
.Nd Common Interface for SCSI-3 Support driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "device scbus"
.Cd "device ciss"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver claims to provide a common interface between generic SCSI
transports and intelligent host adapters.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports
.Em CISS
as defined in the document entitled
.%T "CISS Command Interface for SCSI-3 Support Open Specification, Version 1.04, Valence Number 1" ,
dated 2000/11/27, produced by Compaq Computer Corporation.
.Pp
We provide a shim layer between the
.Nm
interface and
.Xr CAM 4 ,
offloading most of the queueing and being-a-disk chores onto CAM.
Entry to the driver is via the PCI bus attachment
.Fn ciss_probe ,
.Fn ciss_attach ,
etc.\& and via the CAM interface
.Fn ciss_cam_action ,
and
.Fn ciss_cam_poll .
The Compaq
.Nm
adapters require faked responses to get reasonable
behavior out of them.
In addition, the
.Nm
command set is by no means adequate to support the functionality
of a RAID controller,
and thus the supported Compaq adapters utilize portions of the
control protocol from earlier Compaq adapter families.
.Pp
Currently
.Nm
only supports the
.Dq simple
transport layer over PCI.
This interface (ab)uses the I2O register set (specifically the post
queues) to exchange commands with the adapter.
Other interfaces are available, but we are not supposed to know about them,
and it is dubious whether they would provide major performance improvements
except under extreme load.
.Pp
Non-disk devices (such as internal DATs and devices
attached to the external SCSI bus) are supported as normal CAM devices
provided that they are exported by the controller firmware and are not
marked as being masked.
Masked devices can be exposed by setting the
.Va hw.ciss.expose_hidden_physical
tunable to non-zero at boot time.
Direct Access devices (such as disk
drives) are only exposed as
.Xr pass 4
devices.
Hot-insertion and removal of devices is supported but a bus
rescan might be necessary.
