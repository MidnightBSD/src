.Sh NAME
.Nm harp
.Nd pseudo physical interface driver for HARP
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd device atm
.Cd options NATM
.Cd options ATM_CORE
.Cd device harp
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver, when loaded, attaches to all
.Xr netgraph 4
ATM interfaces in the system, and for
each of these interfaces presents a physical interface to the HARP stack.
The name of the
.Nm
physical interface is the same as the name of the
Netgraph interface (they are in different namespaces).
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr fatm 4 ,
.Xr hatm 4 ,
.Xr ng_atm 4 ,
.Xr patm 4 ,
.Xr atm 8
.Sh AUTHORS

.Sh CAVEATS
When
.Xr fatm 4
is used, it must be started before
.Nm
is loaded, to get the correct configuration for the HARP physical interface.
