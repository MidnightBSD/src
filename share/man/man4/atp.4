.Sh NAME
.Nm atp
.Nd Apple touchpad driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines into
your kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device atp"
.Cd "device usb"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
atp_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the Apple Internal Trackpad
device found in many Apple laptops.
.Pp
The driver simulates a three\-button mouse using multi\-finger tap
detection.
.
A single\-finger tap generates a left button click;
two\-finger tap maps to the middle button; whereas a three\-finger tap
gets treated as a right button click.
.
A double\-tap followed by a drag is treated as a selection gesture; a
virtual left\-button click is assumed for the lifespan of the drag.
.
.Nm
attempts to filter away activity at the horizontal edges of the
trackpad\-\-this is to keep unintentional palm movement from being
considered as user input.
.
.Pp
.Nm
supports dynamic reconfiguration using
.Xr sysctl 8 ;
through nodes under
.Nm hw.usb.atp .
Pointer sensitivity can be controlled using the sysctl tunable
.Nm hw.usb.atp.scale_factor .
.
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the following Product IDs:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
Core Duo MacBook & MacBook Pro (IDs: 0x0217, 0x0218, 0x0219)
.It
Core2 Duo MacBook & MacBook Pro (IDs: 0x021a, 0x021b, 0x021c)
.It
Core2 Duo MacBook3,1 (IDs: 0x0229, 0x022a, 0x022b)
.It
12 inch PowerBook and iBook (IDs: 0x030a, 0x030b)
.It
15 inch PowerBook (IDs: 0x020e, 0x020f, 0x0215)
.It
17 inch PowerBook (ID: 0x020d)
.El
.Pp
To discover the product\-id of a touchpad, search for 'Trackpad' in the
output of 
.Xr lshal 1
and look up the property
.Nm usb_device.product_id .
.Sh FILES
.Nm
creates a blocking pseudo\-device file,
.Pa /dev/atp0 ,
which presents the mouse as a
.Ar sysmouse
or 
.Ar mousesystems
type device\-\-see
.Xr moused 8
for an explanation of these mouse
types.
.Xr moused 8
can be configured to read touchpad data from
.Pa /dev/atp0
and pass it along to the 
.Xr sysmouse 4
driver so that any process wanting to utilize mouse operation (such as
an X server) may fetch it from
.Pa /dev/sysmouse ;
alternatively,
.Pa /dev/atp0
may be manipulated via
.Xr read 2
and
.Xr ioctl 2
calls to get mouse data directly.
.Sh EXAMPLES
To use a compatible Apple Trackpad as your console mouse:
.Pp
.Dl moused -p /dev/atp0 -t auto
.Pp
To launch
.Xr moused 8
automatically upon boot, add the following to
.Pa /etc/rc.conf :
.Pp
.Dl moused_enable="YES"
.Dl moused_type="auto"
.Dl moused_port="/dev/atp0"
.Pp
If you want
.Xr moused 8
to also probe for external USB mice or other devices, then add the
following to
.Pa /etc/rc.conf :
.Pp
.Dl moused_nondefault_enable="YES"
.Dl moused_ums0_enable="YES"
.Dl moused_ums1_enable="YES"
.Pp
To be able to use the trackpad under X, change the "Pointer" section in
.Nm xorg.conf
to the following:
.Pp
.Dl Device "/dev/atp0"
.Dl Protocol "Auto"
.Pp
Better still, if you want to be able to use the mouse in both virtual
consoles as well as in X change it to:
.Pp
.Dl Device "/dev/sysmouse"
.Dl Protocol "Auto"
