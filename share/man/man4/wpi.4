.Sh NAME
.Nm wpi
.Nd "Intel 3945ABG Wireless LAN IEEE 802.11 driver"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device wpi"
.Cd "device wpifw"
.Cd "device pci"
.Cd "device wlan"
.Cd "device wlan_amrr"
.Cd "device firmware"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
if_wpi_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the
.Tn Intel
3945ABG Wireless network adapter.
.Nm
supports
.Cm station ,
.Cm adhoc ,
and
.Cm monitor
mode operation.
Only one virtual interface may be configured at any time.
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Pp
This driver requires the firmware built with the
.Nm wpifw
module to work.

.Sh EXAMPLES
Join an existing BSS network (i.e., connect to an access point):
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ifconfig wlan0 create wlandev wpi0 inet 192.168.0.20 \e
    netmask 0xffffff00
.Ed
.Pp
Join a specific BSS network with network name
.Dq Li my_net :
.Pp
.Dl "ifconfig wlan0 create wlandev wpi0 ssid my_net up"
.Pp
Join a specific BSS network with 64-bit WEP encryption:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ifconfig wlan0 create wlandev wpi0 ssid my_net \e
	wepmode on wepkey 0x1234567890 weptxkey 1 up
.Ed
.Pp
Join a specific BSS network with 128-bit WEP encryption:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ifconfig wlan0 create wlandev wpi0 wlanmode adhoc ssid my_net \e
    wepmode on wepkey 0x01020304050607080910111213 weptxkey 1
.Ed
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "wpi%d: could not load firmware image '%s'"
The driver failed to load the firmware image using the
.Xr firmware 9
subsystem.
Verify the 
.Xr wpifw
firmware module is installed.
.It "wpi%d: fatal firmware error"
An unknown error has occurred in the uploaded firmware, you may have to
unload/reload the driver to continue.
.It "wpi%d: Radio transmitter is switched off"
The hardware switch controlling the radio is currently turned off. 
Data transmission is not possible in this state.
