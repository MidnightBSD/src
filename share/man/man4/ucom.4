.Sh NAME
.Nm ucom
.Nd USB tty support
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following line in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device ucom"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ucom_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver attaches to USB modems, serial ports, and other devices that need
to look like a tty.
The
.Nm
driver shows a behavior like a
.Xr tty 4 .
This means that normal programs such as
.Xr tip 1
or
.Xr ppp 8
can be used to access the device.
.Pp
The
.Va portno
locater can be used to decide which port to use for devices that have
multiple external ports.

Prior to

.Nm
created
.Pa /dev/ucom?
rather than the uniform device names created today.
Old scripts must be adjusted accordingly.
