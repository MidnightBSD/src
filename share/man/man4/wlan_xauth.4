.Sh NAME
.Nm wlan_xauth
.Nd External authenticator support for 802.11 devices
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "device wlan_xauth"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
module implements an authenticator plugin that is intended
for use with user-mode authentication implementations such
as
.Nm hostapd .
It hooks into the 802.11 layer and does nothing.
As a result, 802.11 stations that associate are not authorized to
send or receive frames until they are authorized by an external agent;
typically using a protocol such as WPA, 802.1x, or 802.11i.
The
.Nm
module is an 802.11 authenticator plugin module for use by the
.Xr wlan 4
module.
This module is automatically loaded if an application configures
an 802.11 device for operation as an AP with WPA or 802.1x authentication.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr wlan 4
.Sh STANDARDS
More information can be found in the IEEE 802.11, WPA, and 802.11i Standards.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Fx 6.0 .
