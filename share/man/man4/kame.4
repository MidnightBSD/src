.Sh NAME
.Nm KAME
.Nd introduction and roadmap to KAME IPv6 software package
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
software package is a result of joint work of several IPv6 researchers
in Japan, to provide reference implementation of IPv6 to
Berkeley Software Distribution
.Pq Bx
derived system such as
.Bsx ,
.Fx ,
.Nx
and
.Ox
(in alphabetical order).
.Pp
.\" Package consists of set of patches and additions to kernel,
.\" modification to application, daemons, header files and libraries.
KAME kit consists of IPv6/IPsec-ready kernel, application, daemons,
header files and libraries.
.Sh HIGHLIGHTS
Following are some of highlights of this implementation.
.Pp
Note: features not yet integrated into
.Fx
are marked with the
.Pq -
sign.
.\"
.Ss Kernel
IPv6 and IPsec protocol stacks are implemented and available.
See below for conformance to standards and/or internet drafts.

.\"
.Ss Transition Tools
Two IPv4 to IPv6 transition tools are available.
TCP relay translator, FAITH
.Pq Xr faithd 8
and SIIT IPv6-to-v4 header translator implementation
.Pq Xr ptrconfig 8 .

.Xr ping6 8 ,
.Xr traceroute6 8 .
.Pp
Dozen of existing utilities are modified for IPv6/IPsec support, like
.Xr ftp 1
and/or
.Xr telnet 1 .
.\"
.Ss Application Daemons
.Xr inetd 8
modified for IPv4/v6 support, or
IPv6-only
.Xr inet6d 8
.Pq -

.Sh DOCUMENTATION
Although some of documentations have not modified yet, program itself
may be heavily modified.
Following lists are not complete, but give you some idea what kind of
new software modules are available, or, modifications are made.
Please refer to each manual page for detail.
.\"
.Ss Installation and basic usage documentations
Please read the following files in the directories
.Pa /usr/share/doc/IPv6
and
.Pa /usr/share/examples/IPv6
to get a basic idea of (and installation methods for
.Nm .
You also can check out the IPv6 and IPsec chapters in the
.Fx
handbook.
