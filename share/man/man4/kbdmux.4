.Nm kbdmux
.Nd keyboard multiplexer
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd device kbdmux
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
keyboard driver provides support for basic keyboard multiplexing.
It is built around the idea of a
.Dq super keyboard .
.Nm
acts as a master keyboard consuming input from all slave keyboards attached to
it.
.Pp
Slave keyboards can be attached to or detached from the
.Nm
keyboard driver with the
.Xr kbdcontrol 1
utility.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr kbdcontrol 1 ,
.Xr atkbd 4 ,
.Xr pcvt 4 ,
.Xr syscons 4 ,
.Xr ukbd 4
.Sh CAVEATS
The
.Nm
keyboard driver switches all slave keyboards into
.Dv K_RAW
mode.
Thus all slave keyboards attached to the
.Nm
keyboard share the same state.
The
.Nm
keyboard is logically equivalent to one keyboard with lots of duplicated keys.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
module was implemented in
.Fx 6.0 .
