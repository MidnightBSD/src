.Sh NAME
.Nm sfxge
.Nd "Solarflare 10Gb Ethernet adapter driver"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device sfxge"
.Ed
.Pp
To load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
sfxge_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for 10Gb Ethernet adapters based on
Solarflare SFC9000 family controllers.
The driver supports jumbo
frames, transmit/receive checksum offload, TCP Segmentation Offload
(TSO), Large Receive Offload (LRO), VLAN checksum offload, VLAN TSO,
and Receive Side Scaling (RSS) using MSI-X interrupts.  
.Pp
The driver allocates 1 receive queue, transmit queue, event queue and
IRQ per CPU up to a maximum of 64.
IRQ affinities should be spread out using
.Xr cpuset 1 .
Interrupt moderation may be controlled through the sysctl
.Va dev.sfxge.%d.int_mod
(units are microseconds).
.Pp
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Pp
A large number of MAC, PHY and data path statistics are available
under the sysctl
.Va dev.sfxge.%d.stats .
The adapter's VPD
fields including its serial number are available under the sysctl
.Va dev.sfxge.%d.vpd .
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
driver supports all 10Gb Ethernet adapters based on Solarflare SFC9000
family controllers.
