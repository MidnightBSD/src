.Sh NAME
.Nm cxgbe
.Nd "Chelsio T4 10Gb and 1Gb Ethernet adapter driver"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device cxgbe"
.Ed
.Pp
To load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
if_cxgbe_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for PCI Express Ethernet adapters based on
the Chelsio Terminator 4 (T4) ASIC.
The driver supports Jumbo Frames, Transmit/Receive checksum offload,
TCP segmentation offload (TSO), Large Receive Offload (LRO), VLAN
tag insertion/extraction, VLAN checksum offload, VLAN TSO, and
Receive Side Steering (RSS).
For further hardware information and questions related to hardware
requirements, see
.Pa http://www.chelsio.com/ .
.Pp
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
driver supports 10Gb and 1Gb Ethernet adapters based on the T4 ASIC:

Tunables can be set at the
.Xr loader 8
prompt before booting the kernel or stored in
.Xr loader.conf 5 .
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Va hw.cxgbe.ntxq10g
The number of tx queues to use for a 10Gb port.
The default is 16 or the number
of CPU cores in the system, whichever is less.
.It Va hw.cxgbe.nrxq10g
The number of rx queues to use for a 10Gb port.
The default is 8 or the number
of CPU cores in the system, whichever is less.
.It Va hw.cxgbe.ntxq1g
The number of tx queues to use for a 1Gb port.
The default is 4 or the number
of CPU cores in the system, whichever is less.
.It Va hw.cxgbe.nrxq1g
The number of rx queues to use for a 1Gb port.
The default is 2 or the number
of CPU cores in the system, whichever is less.
.It Va hw.cxgbe.nofldtxq10g
The number of TOE tx queues to use for a 10Gb port.
The default is 8 or the
number of CPU cores in the system, whichever is less.
.It Va hw.cxgbe.nofldrxq10g
The number of TOE rx queues to use for a 10Gb port.
The default is 2 or the
number of CPU cores in the system, whichever is less.
.It Va hw.cxgbe.nofldtxq1g
The number of TOE tx queues to use for a 1Gb port.
The default is 2 or the
number of CPU cores in the system, whichever is less.
.It Va hw.cxgbe.nofldrxq1g
The number of TOE rx queues to use for a 1Gb port.
The default is 1.
.It Va hw.cxgbe.holdoff_timer_idx_10G
.It Va hw.cxgbe.holdoff_timer_idx_1G
The timer index value to use to delay interrupts.
The holdoff timer list has the values 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, and 200
by default (all values are in microseconds) and the index selects a
value from this list.
The default value is 1 for both 10Gb and 1Gb ports, which means the
timer value is 5us.
Different cxgbe interfaces can be assigned different values at any time via the
dev.cxgbe.X.holdoff_tmr_idx sysctl.
.It Va hw.cxgbe.holdoff_pktc_idx_10G
.It Va hw.cxgbe.holdoff_pktc_idx_1G
The packet-count index value to use to delay interrupts.
The packet-count list has the values 1, 8, 16, and 32 by default
and the index selects a value from this list.
The default value is -1 for both 10Gb and 1Gb ports, which means packet
counting is disabled and interrupts are generated based solely on the
holdoff timer value.
Different cxgbe interfaces can be assigned different values via the
dev.cxgbe.X.holdoff_pktc_idx sysctl.
This sysctl works only when the interface has never been marked up (as done by
ifconfig up).
.It Va hw.cxgbe.qsize_txq
The size, in number of entries, of the descriptor ring used for a tx
queue.
A buf_ring of the same size is also allocated for additional
software queuing.
See
.Xr ifnet 9 .
The default value is 1024.
Different cxgbe interfaces can be assigned different values via the
dev.cxgbe.X.qsize_txq sysctl.
This sysctl works only when the interface has never been marked up (as done by
ifconfig up).
.It Va hw.cxgbe.qsize_rxq
The size, in number of entries, of the descriptor ring used for an
rx queue.
The default value is 1024.
Different cxgbe interfaces can be assigned different values via the
dev.cxgbe.X.qsize_rxq sysctl.
This sysctl works only when the interface has never been marked up (as done by
ifconfig up).
.It Va hw.cxgbe.interrupt_types
The interrupt types that the driver is allowed to use.
Bit 0 represents INTx (line interrupts), bit 1 MSI, bit 2 MSI-X.
The default is 7 (all allowed).
The driver will select the best possible type out of the allowed types by
itself.
.It Va hw.cxgbe.config_file
Select a pre-packaged device configuration file.
A configuration file contains a recipe for partitioning and configuring the
hardware resources on the card.
This tunable is for specialized applications only and should not be used in
normal operation.
The configuration profile currently in use is available in the dev.t4nex.X.cf
and dev.t4nex.X.cfcsum sysctls.
.It Va hw.cxgbe.linkcaps_allowed
.It Va hw.cxgbe.niccaps_allowed
.It Va hw.cxgbe.toecaps_allowed
.It Va hw.cxgbe.rdmacaps_allowed
.It Va hw.cxgbe.iscsicaps_allowed
.It Va hw.cxgbe.fcoecaps_allowed
Disallowing capabilities provides a hint to the driver and firmware to not
reserve hardware resources for that feature.
Each of these is a bit field with a bit for each sub-capability within the
capability.
This tunable is for specialized applications only and should not be used in
normal operation.
The capabilities for which hardware resources have been reserved are listed in
dev.t4nex.X.*caps sysctls.
