.Sh NAME
.Nm malo
.Nd "Marvell Libertas IEEE 802.11b/g wireless network driver"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device malo"
.Cd "device pci"
.Cd "device wlan"
.Cd "device firmware"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following lines in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
if_malo_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for Marvell Libertas 88W8335 based PCI
and Cardbus network adapters.
.Nm
supports
.Cm station
and
.Cm monitor
mode operation.
Only one virtual interface may be configured at any time.
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Pp
This driver requires the
.Nm malofw
firmware kernel module be installed before it will work.
The firmware files are not publicly available.
A port of the firmware can be found at:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
http://weongyo.org/project/malo/malo-firmware-1.4.tar.gz
.Ed
.Pp
The firmware kernel module can be installed by extracting
the archive and running
.Ql make install clean
in the
.Pa malo-firmware-1.4
directory.
.Sh HARDWARE
The following cards are among those supported by the
.Nm
driver:
.Pp
.Bl -column -compact "Microcom Travelcard" "MALO111" "CardBus" "a/b/g" -offset 6n
.Em "Card	Chip	Bus	Standard"
Netgear WG311v3	88W8335	PCI	b/g
Tenda TWL542P	88W8335	PCI	b/g
U-Khan UW-2054i	88W8335	PCI	b/g
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Join an existing BSS network (i.e., connect to an access point):
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ifconfig wlan create wlandev malo0 inet 192.168.0.20 \e
    netmask 0xffffff00
.Ed
.Pp
Join a specific BSS network with network name
.Dq Li my_net :
.Pp
.Dl "ifconfig wlan create wlandev malo0 ssid my_net up"
.Pp
Join a specific BSS network with 64-bit WEP encryption:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ifconfig wlan create wlandev malo0 ssid my_net \e
	wepmode on wepkey 0x1234567890 weptxkey 1 up
