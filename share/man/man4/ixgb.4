.Sh NAME
.Nm ixgb
.Nd "Intel(R) PRO/10GbE Ethernet driver for the FreeBSD operating system"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following line in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device ixgb"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
if_ixgb_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for PCI Gigabit Ethernet adapters based on
the Intel 82597EX Ethernet controller chips.
The driver supports Transmit/Receive checksum offload
and Jumbo Frames.
.Pp
For questions related to hardware requirements,
refer to the documentation supplied with your Intel PRO/10GbE adapter.
All hardware requirements listed apply to use with
.Fx .
.Pp
Support for Jumbo Frames is provided via the interface MTU setting.
Selecting an MTU larger than 1500 bytes with the
.Xr ifconfig 8
utility configures the adapter to receive and transmit Jumbo Frames.
The maximum MTU size for Jumbo Frames is 16114.
.Pp
This driver version supports VLANs.
For information on enabling VLANs, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
driver supports the following cards:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
Intel PRO/10GbE LR Server Adapter
.It
Intel PRO/10GbE SR Server Adapter
.El
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
