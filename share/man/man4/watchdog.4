.Dt WATCHDOG 4
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm watchdog
.Nd "hardware and software watchdog"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "options CPU_ELAN"
.Cd "options CPU_GEODE"
.Cd "options SW_WATCHDOG"
.Pp
.In sys/watchdog.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
facility is used for controlling hardware and software watchdogs.
.Pp
The interface is through a device named
.Qq Li /dev/
.Dv _PATH_WATCHDOG
which responds to a single
.Xr ioctl 2
call,
.Dv WDIOCPATPAT .
.Pp
The call takes a single argument which represents a timeout value
specified as an integer power of two nanoseconds.
.Pp
The
.Dv WD_ACTIVE
flag signals that the
.Nm
will be kept from
timing out from userland, for instance by the
.Xr watchdogd 8
daemon.
.Pp
To disable the watchdogs, an argument of zero should be used.
.Pp
The
.Xr ioctl 2
call will return success if just one of the available
.Xr watchdog 9
implementations support the request.
If the call fails, for instance if none of
.Xr watchdog 9
implementations support the timeout
length, all watchdogs are disabled and must be explicitly re-enabled.
.Sh EXAMPLES
.\" XXX insert some descriptive text here
.Bd -literal -offset indent
u_int u = WD_ACTIVE | WD_TO_8SEC;
int fd = open("/dev/" _PATH_WATCHDOG, O_RDWR);

ioctl(fd, WDIOCPATPAT, &u);
