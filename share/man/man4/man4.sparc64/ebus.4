.Sh NAME
.Nm ebus
.Nd "EBus controller and bus"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "device ebus"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the EBus controller and bus found in most
.Tn PCI
based
.Tn UltraSPARC
systems.
The
.Tn EBus
bus is designed to provide the ability to put
.Tn ISA
and traditional
.Tn Intel
style peripherals in a
.Tn SPARC
based system with a minimal amount of glue logic.
In
.Tn UltraSPARC
systems it is implemented with either a PCIO or a PCIO-2 chip from
.Tn Sun Microelectronics .
The PCIO chip also implements a
.Xr hme 4
compatible
.Tn PCI
network device.
The PCIO-2 chip also implements a
.Xr fwohci 4
compatible
.Tn IEEE
.Tn 1394
.Tn OHCI
interface, a
.Xr gem 4
compatible
.Tn PCI
network device and an
.Xr ohci 4
compatible
.Tn OHCI
.Tn USB
controller.
The
.Tn EBus
has four DMA channels,
similar to the DMA seen in the
.Xr esp 4
.Tn SCSI
DMA.
