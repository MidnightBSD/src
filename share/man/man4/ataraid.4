.Sh NAME
.Nm ataraid
.Nd "ATA software RAID support"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "device ata"
.Cd "device ataraid"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for so-called software RAID
(sometimes referred to as fake RAID or pseudo RAID).
.Pp
When a controller that supports software RAID is instructed to
create a RAID array, its BIOS writes data structures in a specific
metadata format to the disks.
These data structures are picked up by the
.Nm
driver, so that
.Fx
can work with the array.
The
.Nm
driver has to understand the specific metadata format of a
controller BIOS in order to support its RAID capabilities.
.Pp
Read-only support for a metadata format means that
.Fx
can use the given RAID array for normal read/write operations.
Creation and rebuild of such arrays has to be done from the
controller BIOS.
.Pp
Read and write support for a metadata format means that
.Fx
can use the given RAID array for normal read/write operations.
Additionally, the
.Xr atacontrol 8
utility can be used to create, rebuild, update and fail such
RAID arrays.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver can read the following metadata formats:

that do not have special software RAID capabilities.

RAID5 is not supported at this time.
Code exists, but it neither uses nor maintains parity information.
