.Sh NAME
.Nm axe
.Nd "ASIX Electronics AX88172 USB Ethernet driver"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device ehci"
.Cd "device uhci"
.Cd "device ohci"
.Cd "device usb"
.Cd "device miibus"
.Cd "device axe"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
if_axe_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for USB Ethernet adapters based on the ASIX
Electronics AX88172 USB 2.0 chipset.
.Pp
The AX88172 is a USB 2.0 device which contains a 10/100
Ethernet MAC with MII interface and is designed to work with both
Ethernet and HomePNA transceivers.
The AX88172 will operate with
both USB 1.x and USB 2.0 controllers, however performance with 1.x
controllers will be limited since the USB 1.x standard specifies a
maximum transfer speed of 12Mbps.
Users with USB 1.x controllers should therefore not expect to actually
achieve 100Mbps speeds with these devices.
.Pp
The AX88172 supports a 64-bit multicast hash table, single perfect
filter entry for the station address, all-multicast mode and promiscuous mode.
Packets are
received and transmitted over separate USB bulk transfer endpoints.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media types:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm 10baseT/UTP"
.It Cm autoselect
Enable autoselection of the media type and options.
The user can manually override
the autoselected mode by adding media options to the
.Pa /etc/rc.conf
file.
.It Cm 10baseT/UTP
Set 10Mbps operation.
The
.Cm mediaopt
option can also be used to enable
.Cm full-duplex
operation.
Not specifying
.Cm full-duplex
implies
.Cm half-duplex
mode.
.It Cm 100baseTX
Set 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) operation.
The
.Cm mediaopt
option can also be used to enable
.Cm full-duplex
operation.
Not specifying
.Cm full-duplex
implies
.Cm half-duplex
mode.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media options:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm 10baseT/UTP"
.It Cm full-duplex
Force full duplex operation.
The interface will operate in
half duplex mode if this media option is not specified.
.El
.Pp

.Bl -diag
.It "axe%d: watchdog timeout"
A packet was queued for transmission and a transmit command was
issued, however the device failed to acknowledge the transmission
before a timeout expired.
.It "axe%d: no memory for rx list"
The driver failed to allocate an mbuf for the receiver ring.
