.Sh NAME
.Nm ichwd
.Nd Intel ICH watchdog timer driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd device ichwd
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This driver provides access to the watchdog timer (WDT) present on all
Intel ICH chipsets.
.Pp
The ICH WDT counts down in ticks of approximately 0.6 seconds; the
exact value depends on hardware quality and environmental factors.
Supported watchdog intervals range from 2 to 63 ticks.
.Pp
Note that on some ICH-based systems, the WDT may be present but
disabled, either in hardware or by the BIOS.
The
.Nm
driver attempts to detect this condition and will refuse to attach if
it believes the WDT is disabled.
