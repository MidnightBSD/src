.Sh NAME
.Nm el
.Nd Ethernet driver for 3Com Etherlink 3C501 devices
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "device el"
.Pp
In
.Pa /boot/device.hints :
.Cd hint.el.0.at="isa"
.Cd hint.el.0.port="0x300"
.Cd hint.el.0.irq="9"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Bf -symbolic
This device driver is deprecated and will be removed in
.Fx 7.0 .
.Ef
.Pp
The
.Nm
interface provides support for the 3Com 3c501 8bit ISA Ethernet card.
The 3c501 card is known to be quite slow, and a different Ethernet card
should be used if possible.
However, they allow inexpensive access to 10 Mb/s Ethernet networks.
.Pp
The valid I/O ports are in the range 0x280-0x3f0.
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
driver supports the 3Com 3c501 8bit ISA Ethernet card.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ed 4 ,
.Xr ep 4 ,
.Xr ie 4 ,
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr ng_ether 4 ,
.Xr ifconfig 8
.Sh BUGS
The driver assumes the card is configured for the same IRQ as the kernel.
No probing or checking is done to determine if this is the case.
.Pp
Does not currently support DMA.
.Pp
Does not currently support multicasts.
