.Sh NOTES
Historically, the driver for the Cronyx Tau WAN adapters was
.Dq ct .
This device name was changed to
.Dq ctau
to avoid conflicts
with this pc98
.Nm
driver.
The network device name for
.Xr ctau 4
is
.Dq Li ct .
Please see
.Xr ctau 4
for the details for that device.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver has been developed for
.Nx Ns /pc98
and ported for
.Fx .
It first appeared in
.Fx 4.4 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Naofumi HONDA .
