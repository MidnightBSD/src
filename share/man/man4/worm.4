.Dt WORM 4
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm worm
.Nd write-once (CD-R) disk driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
None.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver was provided under
.Fx
releases prior to
.Fx 3.0 .
.Pp
The
.Fx
.Tn SCSI
layer was replaced for
.Fx 3.0
by a CAM-compliant
.Tn SCSI
layer.
The new
.Tn SCSI
layer does not include a
.Nm
driver, and is not likely to include one in the future.
Future in-kernel
support for CD-R/CD-RW/DVD drives will likely be implemented through the
.Xr cd 4
driver.
Users who wish to write CDs on a WORM, CD-R, or CD-RW drive should use
.Nm cdrtools ,
which is in the
.Fx
ports collection.
.Pp
The
.Xr cd 4
driver provides read-only access to CD, CD-R, and CD-RW drives, as well as
WORM drives that support the CDROM command set.
Therefore, users wishing to mount CDs in a WORM drive should use the
.Xr cd 4
driver instead.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr close 2 ,
.Xr ioctl 2 ,
.Xr open 2 ,
.Xr write 2 ,
.Xr cd 4 ,
.Xr pass 4 ,
.Xr xpt 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver appeared in
.Fx 2.1 ,
and disappeared in
.Fx 3.0
with the advent of the CAM
.Tn SCSI
layer.
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The first skeleton for a
.Nm
driver has been written by
.An Peter Dufault
in May, 1995.
The driver has then been improved and made actually usable at all by
.An J\(:org Wunsch
in January, 1996.
