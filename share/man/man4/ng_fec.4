.Sh NAME
.Nm ng_fec
.Nd netgraph Fast EtherChannel node
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In netgraph/ng_fec.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm fec
node implements Ethernet port trunking using the
.Dq Cisco Fast EtherChannel
protocol.
Upon creation, a
.Nm fec
node creates a network interface associated with it.
Interfaces are named
.Dq Li fec0 ,
.Dq Li fec1 ,
etc.
New nodes take the first available unit.
.Sh HOOKS
The
.Nm fec
node accepts any hooks.
However it does not use them.
Under normal operation, a
.Nm fec
node should not have any hooks.
.Sh CONTROL MESSAGES
Interface membership in the FEC group is configured with the following
control messages:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Dv NGM_FEC_ADD_IFACE Pq Dq Li add_iface
Attach interface to the FEC group.
The target interface name is passed as a string argument.
.It Dv NGM_FEC_DEL_IFACE Pq Dq Li del_iface
Remove interface from the trunk.
The target interface name is passed as a string argument.
.El
.Pp
The following control messages define the forwarding method for a node:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Dv NGM_FEC_SET_MODE_MAC Pq Dq Li set_mode_mac
Forwarding decisions will be based on the link-layer MAC address of the destination.
.It Dv NGM_FEC_SET_MODE_INET Pq Dq Li set_mode_inet
Forwarding decisions will be based on the IP address of the destination.
.El
.Sh SHUTDOWN
This node shuts down upon receipt of a
.Dv NGM_SHUTDOWN
control message.
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following example script creates an
.Nm fec
node, attaches four Ethernet interfaces to it and
sets the forwarding method to be IP-address based:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
/usr/sbin/ngctl -f- << SEQ
	mkpeer fec dummy fec
	msg fec0: add_iface "dc0"
	msg fec0: add_iface "dc1"
	msg fec0: add_iface "dc2"
	msg fec0: add_iface "dc3"
	msg fec0: set_mode_inet
