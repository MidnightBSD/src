.Dt BUILD 7
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm build
.Nd information on how to build the system
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The source for the
.Fx
system and applications are contained in three different directories,
normally
.Pa /usr/src ,
.Pa /usr/doc ,
and
.Pa /usr/mports .
.Pa /usr/src
contains the
.Dq "base system"
sources, which is loosely defined as the things required to rebuild
the system to a useful state.
.Pa /usr/doc
contains the source for the system documentation, excluding the manual
pages.
.Pa /usr/mports
is a tree that provides a consistent interface for building and
installing third party applications.
.Pp
The
.Xr make 1
command is used in each of these directories to build and install the
things in that directory.
Issuing the
.Xr make 1
command in any directory or
subdirectory of those directories has the same effect as issuing the
same command in all subdirectories of that directory.
With no target specified, the things in that directory are just built.
The following
list provides the names and actions for other targets:
.Bl -tag -width indent-two
.It Cm clean
Removes any files created during the build process.
.It Cm install
Installs the results of the build for this directory.
.It Cm update
Gets updated sources as configured in
.Xr make.conf 5 .
.El
.Pp
The other
.Pa /usr/src
make targets are:
.Bl -tag -width indent-two
.It Cm buildworld
Rebuild everything but the kernel, configure files in
.Pa /etc ,
and release.
.It Cm installworld
Install everything built by
.Cm buildworld .
.It Cm buildkernel
Rebuild the kernel and the kernel modules.
.It Cm installkernel
Install the kernel and the kernel modules.
.It Cm reinstallkernel .
Reinstall the kernel and the kernel modules.
.It Cm kernel
Equivalent to
.Cm buildkernel
followed by
.Cm installkernel
.El
.Pp
Convenience targets for cleaning up the install destination directory
denoted by variable
.Va DESTDIR
include:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm delete-old-libs"
.It Cm check-old
Print a list of old files and directores in the system.
.It Cm delete-old
Delete obsolete base system files and directories interactively.
When
.Li -DBATCH_DELETE_OLD_FILES
is specified at the command line, the delete operation will be
non-interactive.
The variables
.Va DESTDIR ,
.Va TARGET_ARCH
and
.Va TARGET
should be set as with
.Dq Li "make installworld" .
.It Cm delete-old-libs
Delete obsolete base system libraries interactively.
This target should only be used if no 3rd party software uses these
libraries.
When
.Li -DBATCH_DELETE_OLD_FILES
is specified at the command line, the delete operation will be
non-interactive.
The variables
.Va DESTDIR ,
.Va TARGET_ARCH
and
.Va TARGET
should be set as with
.Dq Li "make installworld" .
.El
.Pp
For more information about the mports build process, see
.Xr ports 7 .
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width ".Va TARGET_ARCH"
.It Va TARGET_ARCH
The target machine processor architecture.
This is analogous to the
.Dq Nm uname Fl p
output.
Set this to cross-build for a different architecture.
.It Va TARGET
The target hardware platform.
This is analogous to the
.Dq Nm uname Fl m
output.
This is necessary to cross-build some target architectures.
.It Va NO_WERROR
If defined, warnings will not cause the build to halt, even if the
makefile says otherwise.
.It Va DESTDIR
The directory hierarchy where the resulting binaries will be
installed.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width ".Pa /usr/share/examples/etc/make.conf" -compact
.It Pa /usr/doc/Makefile
.It Pa /usr/doc/share/mk/doc.project.mk
.It Pa /usr/mports/Mk/bsd.port.mk
.It Pa /usr/mports/Mk/bsd.sites.mk
.It Pa /usr/share/examples/etc/make.conf
.It Pa /usr/src/Makefile
.It Pa /usr/src/Makefile.inc1
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
For an
.Dq approved
method of updating your system from the latest sources,
please see the
.Sx COMMON ITEMS
section in
.Pa src/UPDATING .
.Pp
The following sequence of commands can be used to cross-build the
system for the Sparc64 architecture on an i386 host:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
cd /usr/src
make TARGET_ARCH=sparc64 buildworld
make TARGET_ARCH=sparc64 DESTDIR=/clients/axp installworld
