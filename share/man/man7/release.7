.Dt RELEASE 7
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm release
.Nd "release building infrastructure"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fx
provides a complete build environment suitable for users to make
full releases of the
.Fx
operating system.
All of the tools necessary to build a release are available from the
.Fx
source code repository in
.Pa src/release .
A complete release can actually be built with only a single command,
including the creation of ISO images suitable for burning to CD-ROM,
memory stick images, and an FTP install directory.
This command is aptly named
.Dq Li "make release" .
.Pp
For some users, it may be desirable to provide an absolutely clean
build environment, with no local modifications to the source tree or to
.Xr make.conf 5 ,
and with clean checkouts of specific versions of the doc, src, and ports
trees. For this purpose, a script
.Pq Pa src/release/generate-release.sh
is provided to automate these checkouts and then execute
.Dq Li "make release"
in a clean
.Xr chroot 8 .
.Pp
Before attempting to build a release, the user is expected to be
familiar with the contents of
.Xr build 7 ,
and should have experience upgrading systems from source.
.Pp
The release build process requires that
.Pa /usr/obj
be populated with the output of
.Dq Li "make buildworld"
and
.Dq Li "make buildkernel" .
This is necessary to provide the object files for the release or, when
using
.Pa generate-release.sh ,
so that the object files for a complete system can be installed into a clean
.Xr chroot 8
environment. In this second case, the built world must be capable of running
on the build system (i.e. it must be for the same architecture and be
compatible with the installed kernel).
The release procedure on some architectures may also require that the
.Xr md 4
(memory disk) device driver be present in the kernel
(either by being compiled in or available as a module).
.Pp
This document does not cover source code management, quality
assurance, or other aspects of the release engineering process.
.Sh CLEAN RELEASE GENERATION
Official releases of FreeBSD are produced in a totally clean environment to
ensure consistency between the versions of the src, ports, and doc trees
and to avoid contamination from the host system (e.g. local patches, changes
to
.Xr make.conf 5 ,
etc.). This is accomplished using the wrapper script
.Pa src/release/generate-release.sh .
.Pp
.Ic generate-release.sh
svn-branch scratch-dir
.Pp
.Ic generate-release.sh
calls
.Dq Li "make installworld"
to generate a
.Xr chroot 8
environment in
.Ar scratch-dir .
It then checks out the src tree specified by
.Ar svn-branch
using
.Xr svn 1
and (optionally) the ports and documentation trees using
.Xr csup 1
or
.Xr cvs 1 .
Once the various source trees have been obtained, it executes
.Dq Li "make release"
within the
.Xr chroot 8
environment and places the result in
.Pa $scratch-dir/R .
Note that because this uses a chroot, it cannot be used to cross-build
.Fx
release media.
.Pp
Environment variables:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm MAKE_FLAGS"
.It Ev CVSUP_HOST
The CVSUP server to use for the doc and ports trees. One of
.Ev CVSUP_HOST
or
.Ev CVSROOT
must be specified for ports and documentation to be included in the release.
.It Ev CVSROOT
The location of the
.Fx
CVS repository to use for the doc and ports trees. One of
.Ev CVSUP_HOST
or
.Ev CVSROOT
must be specified for ports and documentation to be included in the release.
.It Ev CVS_TAG
If the variable
.Ev CVS_TAG
is set, that tag will be used for CVS checkouts (doc and ports), otherwise
.Ic generate-release.sh
will use HEAD.
.It Ev MAKE_FLAGS
This environment variable can be set to pass flags (e.g. -j) to
.Xr make 1
when invoked by the script.
.It Ev SVNROOT
The location of the FreeBSD SVN source repository. Defaults to
.Pa svn://svn.freebsd.org/base .
.It Ev RELSTRING
Optional base name for generated media images (e.g. FreeBSD-9.0-RC2-amd64).
Defaults to the output of
.Ic `uname -s`-`uname -r`-`uname -p`
within the chroot.
.El
.Sh MAKEFILE TARGETS
The release makefile
.Pq Pa src/release/Makefile
is fairly abstruse.
Most developers will only be concerned with the
.Cm release
and
.Cm install
targets.
.\" XXX: Some sort of introduction to this list?  All the others have one.
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm packagesystem"
.It Cm release
Meta-target to build all release media and distributions applicable to this
platform.
.It Cm install
Copy all produced release media to
.Pa ${DESTDIR} .
.It Cm cdrom
Builds installation CD-ROM images. On some systems, this may require that
.Xr mkisofs 8
be installed
.Pq Pa sysutils/cdrtools
and possibly that the
.Xr md 4
(memory disk) device driver be present in the kernel
(either by being compiled in or available as a module). This target
produces files called
.Pa release.iso
and
.Pa bootonly.iso
as its output.
.It Cm memstick
Builds an installation memory stick image named
.Pa memstick .
Not applicable on all platforms. Requires that the
.Xr md 4
(memory disk) device driver be present in the kernel
(either by being compiled in or available as a module).
.It Cm ftp
Creates a directory named
.Pa ftp
containing the distribution files used in network installations
and suitable for upload to an FTP mirror.
.El
.Pp
Major subtargets called by targets above:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm packagesystem"
.It Cm packagesystem
Generates all the distribution archives (e.g. base, kernel, ports, doc)
applicable on this platform.
.It Cm system
Builds a bootable installation system containing all the distribution files
packaged by the
.Cm packagesystem
target, and suitable for imaging by the
.Cm cdrom
and
.Cm memstick
targets.
.It Cm reldoc
Builds the release documentation.
This includes the release notes,
hardware guide, and installation instructions. Other documentation (e.g.
the Handbook) is built during the
.Cm base.txz
target invoked by
.Cm packagesystem.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
Optional variables:
.Bl -tag -width ".Va TARGET_ARCH"
.It Va WORLDDIR
Location of a directory containing the src tree. By default, the directory
above the one containing the makefile
.Pq Pa src .
.It Va PORTSDIR
Location of a directory containing the ports tree. By default,
.Pa /usr/ports .
If it is unset or cannot be found, ports will not be included in the release.
.It Va DOCDIR
Location of a directory containing the doc tree. By default,
.Pa /usr/doc .
If it is unset or cannot be found, most documentation will not be included in
the release; see
.Ev NODOC
below.
.It Va NOPORTS
If defined, the Ports Collection will be omitted from the release.
.It Va NOSRC
If set, do not include system source code in the release.
.It Va NODOC
If defined, the SGML-based documentation from the
.Fx
Documentation Project will not be built.
However, the
.Dq doc
distribution will still be created with the minimal documentation set
provided in
.Pa src/share/doc .
.It Va TARGET
The target hardware platform.
This is analogous to the
.Dq Nm uname Fl m
output.
This is necessary to cross-build some target architectures.
For example, cross-building for PC98 machines requires
.Va TARGET_ARCH Ns = Ns Li i386
and
.Va TARGET Ns = Ns Li pc98 .
If not set,
.Va TARGET
defaults to the current hardware platform.
.It Va TARGET_ARCH
The target machine processor architecture.
This is analogous to the
.Dq Nm uname Fl p
output.
Set this to cross-build for a different architecture.
If not set,
.Va TARGET_ARCH
defaults to the current machine architecture, unless
.Va TARGET
is also set, in which case it defaults to the appropriate
value for that platform.
Typically, one only needs to set
.Va TARGET .

.Sh HISTORY
.Fx
1.x
used a manual checklist, compiled by
.An Rod Grimes ,
to produce a release.
Apart from being incomplete, the list put a lot of specific demands on
available file systems and was quite torturous to execute.
.Pp
As part of the
.Fx 2.0
release engineering effort, significant
effort was spent getting
.Pa src/release/Makefile
into a shape where it could at least automate most of the tediousness
of building a release in a sterile environment.
.Pp
For the
.Fx 9.0
release,
.Pa src/release/Makefile
was overhauled and the wrapper script
.Pa src/release/generate-release.sh
introduced to support the introduction of a new installer.
.Pp
At near 1000 revisions spread over multiple branches, the
.Xr cvs 1
log of
.Pa src/release/Makefile
contains a vivid historical record of some
of the hardships release engineers go through.
