.Sh NAME
.Nm mports
.Nd contributed applications
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Mx
Ports Collection
offers a simple way for users and
administrators to install applications.
Each
.Em port
contains any patches necessary to make the original
application source code compile and run on
.Bx .
Compiling an
application is as simple as typing
.Nm make Cm build
in the port directory!
The
.Pa Makefile
automatically fetches the
application source code, either from a local disk or via FTP, unpacks it
on your system, applies the patches, and compiles it.
If all goes well,
simply type
.Nm make Cm install
to install the application.
.Pp
It is possible to download and use ports from the
.Mx
repository
that are newer than the installed system; however it is important to
install the appropriate
.Dq "Upgrade Kit"
from
.Pa http://www.MidnightBSD.org/ports/
first!
The
.Xr portcheckout 1 Pq Pa mports/devel/portcheckout
script (also a port, of course!) will help to download new mports.
.Pp
For more information about using mports, see
.Dq "Packages and Ports"
in
.%B "The FreeBSD Handbook" ,
.Pa ( file:/usr/share/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/ports.html
or
.Pa http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/ports.html ) .
For information about creating new ports, see
.%B "The Porter's Handbook"
.Pa ( file:/usr/share/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/porters-handbook/index.html
or
.Pa http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/porters-handbook/ ) .
.Sh TARGETS
Some of the targets work recursively through subdirectories.
This lets you, for example, install all of the
.Dq Li biology
ports.
The targets that do this are
.Cm build , checksum , clean , configure ,
.Cm depends , extract , fetch , install ,
and
.Cm package .
.Pp
The following targets will be run automatically by each proceeding
target in order.
That is,
.Cm build
will be run
(if necessary)
by
.Cm install ,
and so on all the way to
.Cm fetch .
Usually, you will only use the
.Cm install
target.
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm configure"
.It Cm config
Configure
.Va OPTIONS
for this port using
.Xr dialog 1 .
.It Cm config-recursive
Configure
.Va OPTIONS
for this port and all its dependencies using
.Xr dialog 1 .
.It Cm fetch
Fetch all of the files needed to build this port from the sites
listed in
.Va MASTER_SITES
and
.Va PATCH_SITES .
See
.Va FETCH_CMD , MASTER_SITE_OVERRIDE
and
.Va MASTER_SITE_BACKUP .
.It Cm checksum
Verify that the fetched distfile's checksum matches the one the port was
tested against.
Defining
.Va NO_CHECKSUM
will skip this step.
.It Cm depends
Install
(or compile if only compilation is necessary)
any dependencies of the current port.
When called by the
.Cm extract
or
.Cm fetch
targets, this is run in piecemeal as
.Cm fetch-depends , build-depends ,
etc.
Defining
.Va NO_DEPENDS
will skip this step.
.It Cm extract
Expand the distfile into a work directory.
.It Cm patch
Apply any patches that are necessary for the port.
.It Cm configure
Configure the port.
Some mports will ask you questions during this stage.
See
.Va INTERACTIVE
and
.Va BATCH .
.It Cm build
Build the port.
This is the same as calling the
.Cm all
target.
.It Cm install
Install the port and register it with the package system.
This is all you really need to do.
.El
.Pp
The following targets are not run during the normal install process.
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm fetch-recursive"
.It Cm showconfig
Display
.Va OPTIONS
config for this port.
.It Cm showconfig-recursive
Display
.Va OPTIONS
config for this port and all its dependencies.
.It Cm rmconfig
Remove
.Va OPTIONS
config for this port.
.It Cm rmconfig-recursive
Remove
.Va OPTIONS
config for this port and all its dependencies.
.It Cm config-conditional
Skip the mports which have already had their
.Va OPTIONS
configured.
.It Cm fetch-list
Show list of files to be fetched in order to build the port.
.It Cm fetch-recursive
Fetch the distfiles of the port and all its dependencies.
.It Cm fetch-recursive-list
Show list of files that would be retrieved by
.Cm fetch-recursive .
.It Cm pretty-print-run-depends-list , pretty-print-build-depends-list
Print a list of all the compile and run dependencies, and dependencies
of those dependencies.
.It Cm clean
Remove the expanded source code.
This recurses to dependencies unless
.Va NOCLEANDEPENDS
is defined.
.It Cm distclean
Remove the port's distfiles and perform the
.Cm clean
target.
The
.Cm clean
portion recurses to dependencies unless
.Va NOCLEANDEPENDS
is defined, but the
.Cm distclean
portion never recurses
(this is perhaps a bug).
.It Cm reinstall
Use this to restore a port after using
.Xr pkg_delete 1
when you should have used
.Cm deinstall .
.It Cm deinstall
Remove an installed port from the system, similar to
.Xr pkg_delete 1 .
.It Cm deinstall-all
Remove all installed mports with the same
.Va PKGORIGIN
from the system.
.It Cm package
Make a binary package for the port.
The port will be installed if it has not already been.
The package is a
.Pa .tbz
file that you can use to
install the port on other machines with
.Xr pkg_add 1 .
If the directory specified by
.Va PACKAGES
does not exist, the package will be put into the current directory.
See
.Va PKGREPOSITORY
and
.Va PKGFILE .
.It Cm package-recursive
Like
.Cm package ,
but makes a package for each depending port as well.
.It Cm readmes
Create a port's
.Pa README.html .
This can be used from
.Pa /usr/mports
to create a browsable web of all ports on your system!
.It Cm search
Search the
.Pa INDEX
file for the pattern specified by the
.Va key
(searches the port name, comment, and dependencies),
.Va name
(searches the port name only),
.Va path
(searches the port path),
.Va info
(searches the port info),
.Va maint
(searches the port maintainer),
.Va cat
(searches the port category),
.Va bdeps
(searches the port build-time dependency),
.Va rdeps
(searches the port run-time dependency)
.Xr make 1
variables, and their exclusion counterparts:
.Va xname , xkey
etc.
For example, one would type:
.Pp
.Dl "cd /usr/mports && make search name=query"
.Pp
to find all mports whose
name matches
.Dq Li query .
Results include the matching mports' path, comment, maintainer,
build dependencies, and run dependencies.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
cd /usr/mports && make search name=pear- \e
    xbdeps=apache
.Ed
.Pp
To find all mports whose
names contain
.Dq Li pear-
and which do not have apache
listed in build-time dependencies.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
cd /usr/mports && make search name=pear- \e
    xname='ht(tp|ml)'
.Ed
.Pp
To find all mports whose names contain
.Dq Li pear- ,
but not
.Dq Li html
or
.Dq Li http .
.Bd -literal -offset indent
make search key=apache display=name,path,info keylim=1
.Ed
.Pp
To find mports that contain
.Dq Li apache
in either of the name, path, info
fields, ignore the rest of the record.
.It Cm describe
Generate a one-line description of each port for use in the
.Pa INDEX
file.
.It Cm index
Create
.Pa /usr/mports/INDEX ,
which is used by the
.Cm pretty-print-*
and
.Cm search
targets.
Running the
.Cm index
target will ensure your
.Pa INDEX
file is up to date with your mports tree.
.It Cm fetchindex
Fetch the
.Pa INDEX
file from the
.Fx
cluster.
.El
