.PP
.Vb 1
\&    check\-sanity fetch checksum extract patch configure build
.Ve
.PP
Please read the comments in the targets section below; you
should be able to use the pre\-* or post\-* targets/scripts
(which are available for every stage except checksum) or
override the do\-* targets to do pretty much anything you want.
.PP
Many of the do\-* targets are wrappers around run\-* targets.
run\-* targets cannot be overridden, they are the default action for the given
do\-* target.  This way, you can override do-foo, twiddle some variables
and then call 'make run\-foo'.
.PP
\&\fB\s-1NEVER\s0\fR override the \*(L"regular\*(R" targets unless you want to open
a major can of worms.
.SH "VARIABLES"
.IX Header "VARIABLES"
.Sh "Global Knobs"
.IX Subsection "Global Knobs"
The following change globals behavoirs for the mports system.
.IP "\s-1PACKAGE_BUILDING\s0" 4
.IX Item "PACKAGE_BUILDING"
If set, the mport system goes into package building mode.  The options
framework is disabled, and the defaults for \s-1OPTIONS\s0 are used instead.  Some
ports may define extra depends in order to create a complete install. 
Probing of the system for versions of installed software (such as apache or
perl) is disabled.
.IP "\s-1USE_MPORT_TOOLS\s0" 4
.IX Item "USE_MPORT_TOOLS"
If set, the mport system will use libmport to make and install mport
archives.  The mport binary system will also be used as the package
database.
.IP "\s-1MPORT_MAINTAINER_MODE\s0" 4
.IX Item "MPORT_MAINTAINER_MODE"
If set, the mports system will perform checks to see if several steps are
successfully completed.
.Sh "Meta Variables"
.IX Subsection "Meta Variables"
These are meta-variables that are automatically set to the system
you are running on.  These are provided in case you need to take
different actions for different values.
.IP "\s-1ARCH\s0" 4
.IX Item "ARCH"
The architecture of the target machine, such as would be returned by \*(L"uname
\&\-p\*(R".  (Note: Ports should test against \s-1ARCH\s0, and not the host machine's
architecture which is \s-1MACHINE_ARCH\s0, to enable ports to be cross-built.)
.IP "\s-1OPSYS\s0" 4
.IX Item "OPSYS"
Portability clause.  This is the operating system the makefile is being used
on.  Automatically set to \*(L"MidnightBSD\*(R", \*(L"FreeBSD,\*(R" \*(L"NetBSD,\*(R" or \*(L"OpenBSD\*(R"
as appropriate.
.IP "\s-1OSREL\s0" 4
.IX Item "OSREL"
The release version (numeric) of the operating system.
.IP "\s-1OSVERSION\s0" 4
.IX Item "OSVERSION"
The value of _\|_MidnightBSD_version.
.IP "\s-1PORTOBJFORMAT\s0" 4
.IX Item "PORTOBJFORMAT"
The object format (\*(L"aout\*(R" or \*(L"elf\*(R").
.Sh "Fundemental Variables"
.IX Subsection "Fundemental Variables"
This is the beginning of the list of all variables that need to be
defined in a port, listed in order that they should be included
to fit in with existing conventions.  (Exception: \s-1MAINTAINER\s0 actually
should appear after \s-1EXTRACT_ONLY\s0 and before \s-1MASTER_SITE_BACKUP\s0).
.PP

happened that affects the port framework itself, but not the distributed
software (e.g., local patches or Makefile changes).
.IP "\s-1PORTEPOCH\s0" 4
.IX Item "PORTEPOCH"
Optional.  In certain odd cases, the \s-1PORTREVISION\s0 logic can be fooled by
ports that appear to go backwards numerically (e.g. if port\-0.3 is newer
than port\-1998). In this case, incrementing \s-1PORTEPOCH\s0 forces the revision.
.Sp

to determine the existence of the dependency is the same as \s-1FETCH_DEPENDS\s0.

.IX Item "LIB_DEPENDS"
A list of \*(L"lib:dir[:target]\*(R" tuples of other ports this package depends on. 
\&\*(L"lib\*(R" is the name of a shared library. make will use \*(L"ldconfig \-r\*(R" to search

.IX Item "USE_PACKAGE_DEPENDS"
Install dependencies from existing packages instead of building the port
from scratch.
.Sh "Built-In Depends"
.IX Subsection "Built-In Depends"
These variables control options about how a port gets built and/or
are shorthand notations for common sets of dependencies.
Use these if your port uses some of the common software packages. By
convention these should be set to 'yes', although they only need to be
defined. Defaults: not set, unless explicitly indicated below.
.PP
This approach to built-in dependencies is going away in the future.  Soon a
declaration like:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& USE_GHOSTSCRIPT_RUN=yes
.Ve
.PP
will be replaced by
.PP
\&\s-1RUN_DEPENDS\s0 +=	\f(CW@ghostscript\fR
.PP
However, some of these so called \*(L"depends\*(R" actually change the behavoir of 
the mports system.  For example, \s-1USE_GMAKE\s0 not only add a dependcy for gmake,
but it uses gmake instead of make to build and install the software.  Options
like \s-1USE_GMAKE\s0 will remain; as USE_* variable will be variables that add 
functionality to the system.  See extensions for more information.
.PP
\&\fB\s-1NOTE\s0\fR:  These ideas are still in maturation.  Changes expected!
.PP
Note: the distinction between the USE_* and WANT_* variables, and the
WITH_* and WITHOUT_* variables, are that the former are restricted to
usage inside the ports framework, and the latter are reserved for user\-
settable options.  (Setting USE_* in /etc/make.conf is always wrong).

versions for their nationality.
.IP "\s-1WITH_GHOSTSCRIPT_GPL\s0" 4
.IX Item "WITH_GHOSTSCRIPT_GPL"

on the setting of \s-1NOMANCOMPRESS\s0, the make rules will compress the
manpages for you.

.IX Subsection "Skipping Steps"
Set these variables if your port doesn't need some of the steps.
Note that there are no \s-1NO_PATCH\s0 or \s-1NO_CONFIGURE\s0 variables because
those steps are empty by default.  \s-1NO_EXTRACT\s0 is not allowed anymore

Comment and Icon may be empty strings (""). Categories may be an empty

If Categories is an empty string, bsd.port.mk will try to deduce a default
