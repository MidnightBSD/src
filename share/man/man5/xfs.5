.Dt XFS 5
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm xfs
.Nd "XFS file system"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To link into the kernel:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "options XFS"
.Ed
.Pp
To load as a kernel loadable module:
.Pp
.Dl "kldload xfs"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver will permit the
.Fx
kernel to access
.Tn XFS
file systems.
.Sh EXAMPLES
To mount a
.Nm
volume located on
.Pa /dev/ad1s1 :
.Pp
.Dl "mount -t xfs -o ro /dev/ad1s1 /mnt"
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr nmount 2 ,
.Xr unmount 2 ,
.Xr fstab 5 ,
.Xr mount 8
.Sh NOTES
The
.Pa sysutils/xfsprogs
port contains the
.Cm mkfs.xfs
utility for
creating XFS file systems, and also other utilities for analyzing,
and repairing XFS file systems.
.Sh HISTORY
XFS was originally written by SGI for the IRIX operating system.
SGI ported XFS to Linux, and released the source code under the GNU
Public License.  For more details, see:
.Pa http://oss.sgi.com/projects/xfs
.Pp
The port to
.Fx
was based on the Linux port, and started by
.An -nosplit
.An Russell Cattelan Aq cattelan@xfs.org ,
.An Alexander Kabaev Aq kan@FreeBSD.org ,
and
.An Craig Rodrigues Aq rodrigc@FreeBSD.org .
.Pp
The
.Nm
file system support
first appeared in
.Fx 7.0 .
.Sh AUTHORS
This manual page was written by
.An Craig Rodrigues Aq rodrigc@FreeBSD.org .
.Sh CAVEATS
The port of XFS to
.Fx
is currently incomplete.
Only read-only access is supported for XFS volumes.
Writing to a volume is not supported.
.Pp
The
.Fl p
flag to
.Cm mkfs.xfs
can be used to create an XFS file system which is populated with files
and other metadata.
This can be used to quickly create a read-only file system which
can be tested on
.Fx .
