.Dt MAILER.CONF 5
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm mailer.conf
.Nd configuration file for
.Xr mailwrapper 8
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The file
.Pa /etc/mail/mailer.conf
contains a series of pairs.
The first member of each pair is the name
of a program invoking
.Xr mailwrapper 8
which is typically a symbolic link to
.Pa /usr/sbin/sendmail .
(On a typical system,
.Xr newaliases 1
and
.Xr mailq 1
would be set up this way.)
The second member of each pair is the name of the program to
actually execute when the first name is invoked.
The file may also
contain comments, denoted by a # mark in the first column of any line.
.Sh FILES
/etc/mail/mailer.conf
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following is an example of how to set up an
.Nm
for traditional sendmail invocation behavior.
.Bd -literal
# Execute the "real" sendmail program, named /usr/libexec/sendmail/sendmail
sendmail	/usr/libexec/sendmail/sendmail
send-mail	/usr/libexec/sendmail/sendmail
mailq		/usr/libexec/sendmail/sendmail
newaliases	/usr/libexec/sendmail/sendmail
.Ed
.Pp
This example shows how to invoke a sendmail-workalike like Postfix in
place of sendmail.
.Bd -literal
# Emulate sendmail using postfix
sendmail	/usr/local/sbin/sendmail
send-mail	/usr/local/sbin/sendmail
mailq		/usr/local/sbin/sendmail
newaliases	/usr/local/sbin/sendmail
.Ed
.Sh SEE ALSO

.Sh BUGS
The entire reason this program exists is a crock.
Instead, a command
for how to submit mail should be standardized, and all the "behave
differently if invoked with a different name" behavior of things like
.Xr mailq 1
should go away.
