.Dt TMPFS 5
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm tmpfs
.Nd "efficient memory file system"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following line in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "options TMPFS"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
tmpfs_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver will permit the
.Fx
kernel to access
.Tn tmpfs
file systems.

To mount a
.Nm
memory file system:
.Pp
.Dl "mount -t tmpfs tmpfs /tmp"
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr nmount 2 ,
.Xr unmount 2 ,
.Xr fstab 5 ,
.Xr mount 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Fx 7.0 .
.Sh AUTHORS
