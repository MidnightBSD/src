.Dt PASSWD 5
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm passwd ,
.Nm master.passwd
.Nd format of the password file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
files are the local source of password information.
They can be used in conjunction with the Hesiod domains
.Sq passwd
and
.Sq uid ,
and the
.Tn NIS
maps
.Sq passwd.byname ,
.Sq passwd.byuid ,
.Sq master.passwd.byname ,
and
.Sq master.passwd.byuid ,
as controlled by
.Xr nsswitch.conf 5 .
.Pp
For consistency, none of these files should ever be modified
manually.
.Pp
The
.Nm master.passwd
file is readable only by root, and consists of newline separated
records, one per user, containing ten colon (``:'') separated
fields.
These fields are as follows:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width password -offset indent
.It name
User's login name.
.It password
User's
.Em encrypted
password.
.It uid
User's id.
.It gid
User's login group id.
.It class
User's login class.
.It change
Password change time.
.It expire
Account expiration time.
.It gecos
General information about the user.
.It home_dir
User's home directory.
.It shell
User's login shell.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
file is generated from the
.Nm master.passwd
file by
.Xr pwd_mkdb 8 ,
has the class, change, and expire fields removed, and the password
field replaced by a
.Ql *
character.
In the
.Nm master.passwd
file, a password of
.Ql *
is used to indicate that no one can ever log into that account
using password authentication (logins through other forms of
authentication, i.e.\& using
.Xr ssh 1
keys, will still work).
The field only contains encrypted passwords, and
.Ql *
can never be the result of encrypting a password.
.Pp
The
.Ar name
field is the login used to access the computer account, and the
.Ar uid
field is the number associated with it.
They should both be unique
across the system (and often across a group of systems) since they
control file access.
.Pp
While it is possible to have multiple entries with identical login names
and/or identical user id's, it is usually a mistake to do so.
Routines
that manipulate these files will often return only one of the multiple
entries, and that one by random selection.
.Pp
The login name must never begin with a hyphen (``-''); also, it is strongly
suggested that neither upper-case characters or dots (``.'') be part
of the name, as this tends to confuse mailers.
No field may contain a
colon (``:'') as this has been used historically to separate the fields
in the user database.
.Pp
The password field is the
.Em encrypted
form of the password, see
.Xr crypt 3 .
If the
.Ar password
field is empty, no password will be required to gain access to the
machine.
This is almost invariably a mistake.
Because these files contain the encrypted user passwords, they should
not be readable by anyone without appropriate privileges.
.Pp
The group field is the group that the user will be placed in upon login.
Since this system supports multiple groups (see
.Xr groups 1 )
this field currently has little special meaning.
.Pp
The
.Ar class
field is a key for a user's login class.
Login classes
are defined in
.Xr login.conf 5 ,
which is a
.Xr termcap 5
style database of user attributes, accounting, resource,
and environment settings.
.Pp
The
.Ar change
field is the number of seconds from the epoch,
.Dv UTC ,
until the
password for the account must be changed.
This field may be left empty to turn off the password aging feature.
.Pp
The
.Ar expire
field is the number of seconds from the epoch,
.Dv UTC ,
until the
account expires.
This field may be left empty to turn off the account aging feature.
.Pp
The
.Ar gecos
field normally contains comma (``,'') separated subfields as follows:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width office -offset indent -compact
.It name
user's full name
.It office
user's office number
.It wphone
user's work phone number
.It hphone
user's home phone number
.El
.Pp
The full name may contain a ampersand (``&'') which will be replaced by
the capitalized login name when the gecos field is displayed or used
by various programs such as
.Xr finger 1 ,
.Xr sendmail 8 ,
etc.
.Pp
The office and phone number subfields are used by the
.Xr finger 1
program, and possibly other applications.
.Pp
The user's home directory is the full
.Ux
path name where the user
will be placed on login.
.Pp
The shell field is the command interpreter the user prefers.
If there is nothing in the
.Ar shell
field, the Bourne shell
.Pq Pa /bin/sh
is assumed.
.Sh HESIOD SUPPORT
If
.Sq dns
is specified for the
.Sq passwd
database in
.Xr nsswitch.conf 5 ,
then
.Nm
lookups occur from the
.Sq passwd
Hesiod domain.
.Sh NIS SUPPORT
If
.Sq nis
is specified for the
.Sq passwd
database in
.Xr nsswitch.conf 5 ,
then
.Nm
lookups occur from the
.Sq passwd.byname ,
.Sq passwd.byuid ,
.Sq master.passwd.byname ,
and
.Sq master.passwd.byuid
.Tn NIS
maps.
.Sh COMPAT SUPPORT
If
.Sq compat
is specified for the
.Sq passwd
database, and either
.Sq dns
or
.Sq nis
is specified for the
.Sq passwd_compat
database in
.Xr nsswitch.conf 5 ,
then the
.Nm
file also supports standard
.Sq +/-
exclusions and inclusions, based on user names and netgroups.
.Pp
Lines beginning with a ``-'' (minus sign) are entries marked as being excluded
from any following inclusions, which are marked with a ``+'' (plus sign).
.Pp
If the second character of the line is a ``@'' (at sign), the operation
involves the user fields of all entries in the netgroup specified by the
remaining characters of the
.Ar name
field.
Otherwise, the remainder of the
.Ar name
field is assumed to be a specific user name.
.Pp
The ``+'' token may also be alone in the
.Ar name
field, which causes all users from either the Hesiod domain
.Nm
(with
.Sq passwd_compat: dns )
or
.Sq passwd.byname
and
.Sq passwd.byuid
.Tn NIS
maps (with
.Sq passwd_compat: nis )
to be included.
.Pp
If the entry contains non-empty
.Ar uid
or
.Ar gid
fields, the specified numbers will override the information retrieved
from the Hesiod domain or the
.Tn NIS
maps.
As well, if the
.Ar gecos ,
.Ar dir
or
.Ar shell
entries contain text, it will override the information included via
Hesiod or
.Tn NIS .
On some systems, the
.Ar passwd
field may also be overridden.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width ".Pa /etc/master.passwd" -compact
.It Pa /etc/passwd
.Tn ASCII

.It Pa /etc/pwd.db
.Xr db 3 Ns -format

.It Pa /etc/master.passwd
.Tn ASCII

.It Pa /etc/spwd.db
.Xr db 3 Ns -format

.El
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
The password file format has changed since
.Bx 4.3 .
The following awk script can be used to convert your old-style password
file into a new style password file.
The additional fields
.Dq class ,
.Dq change
and
.Dq expire
are added, but are turned off by default.
Class is currently not implemented, but change and expire are; to set them,
use the current day in seconds from the epoch + whatever number of seconds
of offset you want.

.Sh HISTORY
A
.Nm
file format appeared in
.At v6 .
.Pp
The
.Tn NIS
.Nm
file format first appeared in SunOS.
.Pp
The Hesiod support first appeared in
.Fx 4.1 .
It was imported from the
.Nx
Project, where it first appeared in
.Nx 1.4 .
.Sh BUGS
User information should (and eventually will) be stored elsewhere.
.Pp
Placing
.Sq compat
exclusions in the file after any inclusions will have
unexpected results.
