.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
functions are designed to copy small amounts of data from user-space.
.Pp
The
.Nm
routines provide the following functionality:
.Bl -tag -width "fuswintr()"
.It Fn fubyte
Fetches a byte of data from the user-space address
.Pa base .
.It Fn fuword
Fetches a word of data from the user-space address
.Pa base .
.It Fn fuword16
Fetches 16 bits of data from the user-space address
.Pa base .
.It Fn fuword32
Fetches 32 bits of data from the user-space address
.Pa base .
.It Fn fuword64
Fetches 64 bits of data from the user-space address
.Pa base .
.It Fn fuswintr
Fetches a short word of data from the user-space address
.Pa base .
This function is safe to call during an interrupt context.
.El
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Nm
functions return the data fetched or -1 on failure.
