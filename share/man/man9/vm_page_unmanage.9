.Sh NAME
.Nm vm_page_unmanage
.Nd "make a page unmanaged"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/param.h
.In vm/vm.h
.In vm/vm_page.h
.Ft void
.Fn vm_page_unmanage "vm_page_t m"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn vm_page_unmanage
function flags that the page should no longer be managed by the VM system like
other pages.
The page is removed from any page queue it may be on, and after its
.Dv PG_UNMANAGED
flag is set, the page daemon will ignore it (if the page is
currently wired, it will not be removed from its current queue).
.Pp
Unmanaged pages are used by
.Dv OBJT_PHYS
objects to provide physical memory backed storage.
