.Dt VFS_MOUNTEDON 9
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm vfs_mountedon
.Nd "check if the vnode belongs to a mounted file system"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/param.h
.In sys/mount.h
.Ft int
.Fn vfs_mountedon "struct vnode *vp"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn vfs_mountedon
inspects the
.Vt mount
structure in
.Fa vp
to determine if it points to a valid mount point.
If the mount is valid, the vnode is considered to be busy.
.Pp
A common use of
.Fn vfs_mountedon
is to call it on device vnodes to determine if they are already associated with
a file system.
This is done to prevent multiple mounts on the same device.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Er EBUSY
is returned if the vnode has a valid mount point; otherwise, 0 is returned.
.Sh PSEUDOCODE
.Bd -literal
int
ffs_mountfs(devvp, mp, td, malloctype)
	register struct vnode *devvp;
	struct mount *mp;
	struct thread *td;
	struct malloc_type *malloctype;
{
	...

	error = vfs_mountedon(devvp);
	if (error)
		return (error);

	...
}
