.Sh NAME
.Nm vhold , vdrop , vdropl
.Nd "acquire/release a hold on a vnode"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/param.h
.In sys/vnode.h
.Ft void
.Fn vhold "struct vnode *vp"
.Ft void
.Fn vdrop "struct vnode *vp"
.Ft void
.Fn vdropl "struct vnode *vp"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn vhold
function increments the
.Va v_holdcnt
of the given vnode.
If the vnode has already been added to the free list and is still referenced,
it will be removed.
.Pp
The
.Fn vdrop
and
.Fn vdropl
functions decrement the
.Va v_holdcnt
of the vnode.
If the holdcount is less than or equal to zero prior to calling
.Fn vdrop
or
.Fn vdropl ,
the system will panic.
If the vnode is no longer referenced, it will be freed.
.Pp
The difference between
.Fn vdrop
and
.Fn vdropl
is that
.Fn vdrop
locks the vnode interlock and then calls
.Fn vdropl
while
.Fn vdropl
expects the interlock to already be locked.
