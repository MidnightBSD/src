.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions activate or deactivate a previously allocated resource.
In general, resources must be activated before they can be accessed by
the driver so that the bus driver can map the resource into the
devices space.
.Pp
The arguments are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fa dev
The device that requests ownership of the resource.
Before allocation, the resource is owned by the parent bus.
.It Fa type
The type of resource you want to allocate.
It is one of:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width ".Dv SYS_RES_MEMORY" -compact
.It Dv SYS_RES_IRQ
for IRQs
.It Dv SYS_RES_DRQ
for ISA DMA lines
.It Dv SYS_RES_IOPORT
for I/O ports
.It Dv SYS_RES_MEMORY
for I/O memory
.El
.It Fa rid
A pointer to a bus specific handle that identifies the resource being allocated.
.It Fa r
A pointer to the
.Vt "struct resource"
returned by
.Xr bus_alloc_resource 9 .
