.Sh DESCRIPTION
The firmware abstraction provides a convenient interface for loading firmware
images into the kernel.
Specially crafted kernel modules are used to hold the firmware images.
.Pp
The function
.Fn firmware_register
is used on load of such modules to register contained firmware images.
The arguments to
.Fn firmware_register
include a name that identifies the image for later requests to the firmware
system, a pointer to the actual image, the size of the image and an optional
parent image.
The parent image is used to keep track of references to a given module so that
it can be unloaded on last reference.
.Pp
The function
.Fn firmware_unregister
removes the firmware image identified by the name from the system if there
are no pending references or returns an error otherwise.
.Pp
The function
.Fn firmware_get
returns the requested firmware image.
If the image is not yet registered with the system
.Fn firmware_get
tries to load a module with the corresponding name.
This involves the linker subsystem and disk access which is why
.Fn firmware_get
must not be called with any locks (except for Giant).
On success
.Fn firmware_get
returns a pointer to the image description and increases the reference count
for this image.
.Pp
The function
.Fn firmware_put
is used to drop the reference to a firmware image.
The flags argument may be set to
.Dv FIRMWARE_UNLOAD
to indicate that the caller wishes to unload the corresponding module if the
image becomes unreferenced.
