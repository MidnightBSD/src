.Sh NAME
.Nm ieee80211_crypto_attach , ieee80211_crypto_detach , ieee80211_wep_crypt
.Nd 802.11 WEP encryption functions
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Ft void
.Fn ieee80211_crypto_attach "struct ifnet *ifp"
.Ft void
.Fn ieee80211_crypto_detach "struct ifnet *ifp"
.Ft struct mbuf *
.Fn ieee80211_wep_crypt "struct ifnet *ifp" "struct mbuf *m0" "int txflag"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions provide software encryption support
for 802.11 device drivers.
.Pp
.\"
The
.Fn ieee80211_crypto_attach
function initializes crypto support for the interface
.Fa ifp ,
and sets the initialization vector (IV) for WEP encryption to
a random number derived from a secure PRNG.
.Pp
.\"
The
.Fn ieee80211_crypto_detach
function frees data structures associated with crypto support
for the interface
.Fa ifp .
.Pp
.\"
The
.Fn ieee80211_wep_crypt
function runs the appropriate WEP encryption algorithm over the 802.11
encapsulated frame held in the mbuf chain
.Fa m0 ,
for transmission or reception on the interface
.Fa ifp .
The
.Fa txflag
argument specifies whether the frame is being received or transmitted.
A value of 0 indicates that the frame is being received and should
therefore be decrypted; a non-zero value indicates that the frame
is being transmitted
and should be encrypted.
.\"
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
The
.Fn ieee80211_wep_crypt
function stores its IV in the interface's embedded
.Vt struct ieee80211com
instance.

series of functions first appeared in
.Nx 1.5 ,
and were later ported to
.Fx 4.6 .
