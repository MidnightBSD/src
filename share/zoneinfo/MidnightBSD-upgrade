To update timezone information, perform the following steps.

1. Download the new tzdata file from 
   ftp://elsie.nci.nih.gov/pub/

2. Verify the zones were not broken up into seperate files from the last import.

3. Copy the files into src/share/zoneinfo/

4. Test install  and also run tzsetup

5. If some of the country names have changed, you may need to update
    src/share/misc/iso3166. That is a seperate process.
 
6. iso3166.tab should not be placed in the zoneinfo directory.  It is
   different than the file mentioned in step 5.
