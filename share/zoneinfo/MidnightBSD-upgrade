To update timezone information, perform the following steps.

1. Download the new tzdata file from 
   ftp://elsie.nci.nih.gov/pub/

2. Verify the zones were not broken up into seperate files from the last import.

3. Copy the files into src/share/zoneinfo/

4. Test install.  If some of the country names have changed, you may need to import iso3166.tab.  iso3166.tab should not be placed in the zoneinfo directory, but instead in src/share/misc/iso3166.
