pjdfstest test suite execution is integrated into kyua. This README describes
how to use pjdfstest in the default configuration (kyua work directory), and
with a specific filesystem path.

Method 1. Executing with default configuration (kyua work directory)

    1. Elevate privileges:
       % su -
    2. cd to the tests directory:
       % cd /usr/tests/sys/pjdfstest
    3. Run kyua:
       % kyua test

   Executing the commands as shown above will run pjdfstest in the kyua work
   directory. The kyua work directory defaults to a random generated path under
   /tmp; please see TMPDIR in kyua(1) for more details on how the temporary path
   is chosen with kyua.

Method 2. Executing with a specific filesystem path (in this case /mnt)

    1. Elevate privileges:
       % su -
    2. cd to the tests directory:
       % cd /usr/tests/sys/pjdfstest
    3. Run kyua:
       % env PJDFSTEST_TEST_PATH=/mnt kyua test

   WARNING: the above method violates the test program isolation algorithm
   described in kyua(1); as such, $PJDFSTEST_TEST_PATH must be cleaned up after
   executing the testcases.

   It's highly recommended that $PJDFSTEST_TEST_PATH be pointed to a sandboxed
   filesystem, e.g. a small UFS-formatted memory disk or ZFS dataset with
   quotas enabled, so the filesystem can be easily destroyed after the test
   execution is complete, and the testcases are properly bounded both in terms
   of time and space.
