What is this stuff?
-------------------
The Advanced Networking Group (ANG) at the Minnesota Supercomputer Center,
Inc. (MSCI), as part of its work on the MAGIC Gigabit Testbed, developed
the Host ATM Research Platform (HARP) software, which allows IP hosts to
communicate over ATM networks using standard protocols.  It is intended to
be a high-quality platform for IP/ATM research.

HARP provides a way for IP hosts to connect to ATM networks.  It supports 
standard methods of communication using IP over ATM.  A host's standard IP 
software sends and receives datagrams via a HARP ATM interface.  HARP provides 
functionality similar to (and typically replaces) vendor-provided ATM device 
driver software.

HARP includes full source code, making it possible for researchers to
experiment with different approaches to running IP over ATM.  HARP is 
self-contained; it requires no other licenses or commercial software packages.

HARP implements support for the IETF Classical IP model for using IP over ATM 
networks, including:

   o IETF ATMARP address resolution client
   o IETF ATMARP address resolution server
   o IETF SCSP/ATMARP server
   o UNI 3.1 and 3.0 signalling protocols
   o Fore Systems's SPANS signalling protocol

Suggestions and Problem Reports
-------------------------------
While HARP is made available "as is" and is not supported, ANG is continuing
development of HARP.  We welcome suggestions for new or enhanced features, 
summaries of your experience with HARP, as well as reports of problems which
you may experience.  Feel free to contact us at harp-bugs@magic.net.

ANG is maintaining a mail list of those who wish to share their experiences
with HARP, learn of others' experiences, or receive information about future 
releases of HARP.  The HARP mailing list is at harp@magic.net.  To be added
to the list, send email to harp-request@magic.net.
