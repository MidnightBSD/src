# This is an example ppp profile for bringing up a multilink ppp connection
# over ISDN.  It needs at least version 0.83.0 of the i4b code.  An example
# isdnd configuration file is also supplied in this directory (isdnd.rc)
#
# NOTE: This is for use with i4b-supported ISDN cards.  If you have an
# external Terminal Adapter (TA) plugged into a serial port on your
# machine, you should use the TA example in ppp.conf.sample.
#

#
# And of course just in case of a weekend reboot, add
