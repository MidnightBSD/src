# path has to match the relative path within the source tree in which
# these files are found modulo the tests/ component at the end.

# For example: if this Makefile were in src/bin/cp/tests/, its TESTSDIR
# would point at ${TESTSBASE}/bin/cp/.

# Tell bsd.test.mk that we are providing a hand-crafted Kyuafile in this
# directory.  We do so because the file in this directory exists for
# documentation purposes.

# In general, however, you should NOT define KYUAFILE at all to allow
# bsd.test.mk auto-generate one for you based on the ATF_TESTS_*
# definitions from above.
