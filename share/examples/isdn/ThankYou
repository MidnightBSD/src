I would like to thank the following people and organisations:
-------------------------------------------------------------

Gary Jennejohn		for his constant kind support while writing isdn4bsd 
			during that year. Gary always runs the latest and 
			greatest FreeBSD-current and makes isdn4bsd run 
			there, if his root fs is intact, of course! :-).
			In February 1999, Gary contributed the AVM Fritz!
			Card PCI driver to isdn4bsd.

Martin Husemann		is a major contributor to isdn4bsd. He wrote almost
			all of the NetBSD support for isdn4bsd, the monitor
			network code and the Diehl driver. He constantly 
			tries put strange macros into i4b ... ;-)

Serge Vakulenko		for writing the sppp driver and making it freely 
			available.

Joerg Wunsch		for adapting the synchronous PPP stuff to i4b.
			Gary finished this and integrated the PPP stuff into 
			current isdn4bsd.

Wolfgang Helbig		for many patches, polishing isdn4bsd and layer 1 
			debugging.

Thomas Halenbeck and
Stephan Forth		of FORTH EDV in Mainz donated two AVM A1 card and 
			one AVM B1 card to support the development and 
			maintenance of drivers for this cards. Thomas donated
			three more AVM A1 cards in the meantime - Thank you!

Arne Helme 		for the initial work on how to support IOM-2 based 
			boards.

Andrew Gordon 		for disassembling an old AVM A1 and documenting it. 
			Andrew added VJ header compression to the ipr interface 
			and is a constant source of various hints and 
			suggestions :-)
			Andrew sent in a Teles S0/16 PnP for FreeBSD newbus
			conversion, thanks a lot!

Juergen Krause		and someone who does not want to be mentioned anymore 
			for the work on the first ISDN package for FreeBSD.

Michael Elbel		for supporting the development with ftp/www/mail 
			resources.

Leo Weppelman		for the port to the NetBSD/Atari platform.

Bas Oude Nijeweme 	for the port to OpenBSD/i386 2.2.

German Tischler		for the driver for the Sedlbauer WinSpeed card,
			for the PnP support for FreeBSD and for constant
			testing and contributions. German did the initial
			mostly complete conversion of the layer1 code
			to the FreeBSD 4.0 new-bus driver architecture!

Matthias Apitz		for the driver for the AVM PCMCIA Fritz!Card.

Martijn Plak		for the Dynalink driver.

Ignatios Souvatzis  	for the NetBSD/Amiga port and associated driver(s).

Christoph Weber-Fahr	donated an AVM B1 card to support development of a
			driver. Thanks a lot, Christoph!

Eivind Eklund		for the PnP support for FreeBSD, for __FreeBSD_version
			and more.

Karsten Keil		author of the hisax isdn4linux driver for some details
			about the one or the other piece of hardware.

Bert Driehuis		for the support of the BSDI BSD/OS 4.0 operating system

Barry Scott		for fixed charging units shorthold mode support (as
			used in the UK by British Telecom).

Poul-Henning Kamp	for the work on DTMF decoding and many hints, fixes
			and suggestions.

Stefan Bethke		for the work on the audio format conversion stuff in
			the telephony paths.

Udo Schweigert		for PCMCIA support and work on FreeBSD 2.2x 
			compatibility. Udo contributed the AVM Fritz PnP
			and the Siemens I-Surf V2.0 driver.

Ernst Winter		donated a Fritz!Card PCI which was used to develop
			and test the driver.

Harald Frank            long-term loan of an ISDN Blaster board.

Uwe Laverenz		for the donation of an ELSA PCC-16 card

Luke Roberts		for the long time loan a Dynalink ISDN intern PCI card

Marc van Kempen		for the donation of a Dynalink ISDN intern PCI card

Christoph Kukulies	for the donation of an ITK ix1 card

Nikolay Sturm 		sent in patches to get OpenBSD 2.6 supported.

Dave Boyce		wrote a driver for the Winbond W6692 PCI ISDN
			chip which eventually lead to a layer 1 reorg.

			machine for isdn4bsd from an 486 to a Pentium II.
			Thank you very, very much, Andreas !

3Com USRobotics		Christian Weissgerber of 3Com USRobotics in Munich 
			donated a passive "Sportster ISDN TA intern" ISDN 
			card and complete hardware documentation for the card.
