1. How do I get started with synchronous PPP (sPPP) ?
================================================================================

  Of course you first have to have sPPP interfaces in your kernel. If
  you installed everything using FreeBSD/install.sh then the correct
  entries should have been automatically made in /sys/conf/files for you.
  For NetBSD it isn't quite as simple since NetBSD/install-netbsd.sh does
  not do it for you.

  Then all you need to do is put an entry like this:

  	device   "i4bisppp"      4

  into your kernel configuration file (if it's not already there) and
  generate and boot the new kernel. The above line will give you 4
  sPPP interfaces - isp0 to isp3.

  Then just modify /etc/isdn/isdnd.rc (see the example in etc-isdn/isdnd.rc)
  to suit your needs (telephone numbers, etc).

  The next step is to read the ispppcontrol man page and then to look at
  etc/rc.isdn-PPP. ispppcontrol is a very important component in getting
  sPPP working correctly and the ispppcontrol lines in your /etc/rc.isdn
  must be correct.

  In my experience there are two things which can cause problems:

  1) the authproto line has to agree with what your ISP desires. In
     general I've found that it's best to have something like this -

  	ispppcontrol <interface> myauthproto={pap,chap} myauthname=<AuthName>
  		myauthsecret=<AuthSecret> hisauthproto=none callin

     The "hisauthproto=none" is usually needed because the ISP does not want
     to authorise himself to you; he expects you to authorize yourself to him !
     I once forgot to set hisauthproto and it took me quite a while to figure
     out why I couldn't connect.

  2) the IP address at your ISP's end must be correct.

  How can I find out (1) whether my ISP wants pap or chap and (2) what his
  IP address is ? you might ask. Generally, your ISP should have provide
  this information to you. But, if he didn't, or you've mislayed the
  documentation (as I did), there's still hope.

  Fortunately, J"org Wunsch implemented the sPPP kernel code so that it
  provides all the information required if the interface is configured
  with the debug flag set (e.g. ``ifconfig isp0 debug''). It's just a
  little cryptic.

  By the way, I suggest turning the debug flag on until you have things
  working and then turning it off. The debug output is rather voluminous
  and could fill up your /var partition, otherwise.

  The debug output will appear on the console and also be logged to
  /var/log/messages (under FreeBSD) unless you changed /etc/syslog.conf.

  A. How to figure out the authproto
  ----------------------------------

  Here is an example where I configured isp0 with myauthproto=pap, my
  ISP wanted chap, but was willing to accept pap:

  /kernel: isp0: lcp up(starting)
  /kernel: isp0: lcp output <conf-req id=0x7 len=10 5-6-34-e4-30-5a>
  /kernel: isp0: lcp input(req-sent): <conf-req id=0x1 len=30 0-4-0-0-1-4-5-
  f4-3-5-c2-23-5-11-4-5-f4-13-9-3-0-c0-7b-6e-fe-b5>
         ^^^^^
             |___ c223 is chap, it's what the ISP wants to use

  /kernel: isp0: lcp parse opts:  0x0 [rej]  mru  auth-proto  0x11 [rej]
  x13 [rej]  send conf-rej (I didn't agree)
  /kernel: isp0: lcp output <conf-rej id=0x1 len=21 0-4-0-0-11-4-5-f4-13-9-3-
  0-c0-7b-6e-fe-b5>
  /kernel: isp0: lcp input(req-sent): <conf-ack id=0x7 len=10 5-6-34-e4-30-5a>
  /kernel: isp0: lcp input(ack-rcvd): <conf-req id=0x2 len=13 1-4-5-f4-3-5-
  c2-23-5>
  /kernel: isp0: lcp parse opts:  mru  auth-proto
  /kernel: isp0: lcp parse opt values:  mru 1524  auth-proto [mine 0x0 !=
  his chap]  send conf-nak (we want to use pap, not chap)
  /kernel: isp0: lcp output <conf-nak id=0x2 len=9 3-5-c0-23-5>
                                                         ^^^^^
                                                             |___ c023 is pap

  /kernel: isp0: lcp input(ack-rcvd): <conf-req id=0x3 len=12 1-4-5-f4-3-4-
  c0-23> (he agrees to use pap)
  /kernel: isp0: lcp parse opts:  mru  auth-proto
  /kernel: isp0: lcp parse opt values:  mru 1524  auth-proto  send conf-ack
  /kernel: isp0: lcp output <conf-ack id=0x3 len=12 1-4-5-f4-3-4-c0-23>
  					he agrees to use pap ___|^^^^^

  so, if you have problems in the lcp phase, check which authentication method
  your ISP wants to use. Usually chap is prefered, but pap will be accepted.

  B. How to figure out the ISP's IP address

	Gary answers:
	-------------
	I think you're right. I wrote that stuff before the support for
	negotiation of the IPS's address was added to if_spppsubr.c.

	======================================================================


  I also intentionally configured the interface with the wrong address for
  my ISP, like this:

  	ifconfig isp0 0.0.0.0 10.0.0.1 debug link1

  this means that I want the ISP to assign me an address (the 0.0.0.0) and
  that I expect him to use 10.0.0.1 (which is wrong). Here's the result:
  (note that these addresses have been changed by me)

  /kernel: isp0: phase network
  /kernel: isp0: ipcp open(initial)
  /kernel: isp0: ipcp up(starting)
  /kernel: isp0: ipcp output <conf-req id=0x9 len=10 3-6-0-0-0-0>

  /kernel: isp0: ipcp parse opts:  compression [rej]  address  send conf-rej
  /kernel: isp0: ipcp output <conf-rej id=0x1 len=10 2-6-0-2d-f-1>
  /kernel: isp0: ipcp input(req-sent): <conf-nak id=0x9 len=10 3-6-c-22-38-4e>
  /kernel: isp0: ipcp nak opts:  address [wantaddr 12.34.56.78] [agree]
                                                     ^^^^^
                                                         |___ he assigns me this

  /kernel: isp0: ipcp output <conf-req id=0xa len=10 3-6-c3-b4-eb-63>
  /kernel: isp0: ipcp input(req-sent): <conf-req id=0x2 len=10 3-6-62-4c-36-20>
  /kernel: isp0: ipcp parse opts:  address
  /kernel: isp0: ipcp parse opt values:  address 98.76.54.32 [not agreed]
                                                   ^^^^^
                                                        |_this is *his* address
  send conf-nak
  /kernel: isp0: ipcp output <conf-nak id=0x2 len=10 3-6-a-0-0-1>
  	I expect a different address and (incorrectly) reject what he wants.
  	I tell him that I expect 10.0.0.1. After this the connection fails.

  Anyway, I now know that his address is really 98.76.54.32 and can use
  it to correctly configure the interface.

  With the correct IP address I shoulkd now be able to connect with no
  problems. As stated above, the authorization protocol is normally not
  so important since most ISPs are willing to use pap, although chap is
  more secure. Generally, I'd try chap first and only switch to pap if
  the ISP doesn't accept it.

2. does anyone know a software that can receive/send fax over ISDN ?
================================================================================

This is probably not implemented.

Implementing G3 fax in ISDN would mean simulating an analog modem
on the digital link. This means having to generate the right waveforms
for the modulated data, and receive analog data from the other end
which you had to run FFT analysis on and then interpret.

In addition you have to do this in realtime, to be able to deal with
the timing involved in the fax protocol, something neither
FreeBSD or Linux is good at in their native form..

A third point is that a software simulated faxmodem usually does not
work well. I tested Teles software faxmodem in Win-95 towards an Ericsson V34
HE modem, and was able to send faxes from the ISDN card at 4800 baud
only, and receive faxes ad 9600 baud only(!) (And it is not the
Ericsson modems fault, it works flawlessly towards other fax machines.)

My point is that the best thing to do is to use an ordinary faxmodem
to handle faxes with Hylafax of mgetty+sendfax or efax, or you may use
a combined ISDN card with an analog part.

Of course, if you are crazy enough, you may try to implement a
software simulated modem in e.g. RT-linux, or a similar realtime
extension for FreeBSD.

3. does i4b callback only work with setups where the remote end returns a busy ?
================================================================================

> Is my assumption correct, does i4b callback only work with setups where
> the remote end returns a busy on the dialin?

Yes - otherwise you'll pay for the connection, at least here in Germany.

Most routers support two kind of callbacks - the one that i4b supports
means: the called system rejects (so no charge for this connection), waits
a configurable time and the calls back. Information on who has called and
who is to be called back relies on the ISDN calling party number information
and stuff statically configured in the routers (or isnd's) configuration.

The other type of callback (not supported by i4b right now) means: the
called system accepts the connection and starts ppp negotiation. During this
the ppp's aggree to do a callback. Information on who called in and who is
going to be called back is subject to the authentication/negotiation already
done by the two ppp's. Then ppp closes down, the connection is disconnected
and the called system calls back.

I've never seen someone actually use the second type due to its obvious
disadvantages. It may be usefull if you travel, call in from an unknown
number and want to be called back at that number.

4. trouble with kernel options IPFIREWALL and IPDIVERT and natd

I had exactly the same problems. natd doesn't seem to get a message if
the IP address of the interface changes (after successful dialout).
I have to manually send a HUP signal to natd. I do this via the following
(ugly?!) hack:

I added the following two lines to the system section of isdnd.rc:
regexpr         = "call active"         # look for matches in log messages
regprog         = hup_natd              # execute program whan match is found

The small script "hup_natd", located in /etc/isdn, looks like:
#!/bin/sh
pid=`cat /var/run/natd.pid`
kill -HUP $pid
sleep 3
kill -HUP $pid
sleep 5
kill -HUP $pid

It looks ugly, but at least for me it works. The two sleeps are necessary
since I have to wait for ppp negotiation to complete (I don't get a message
from isdnd for that). If I'm lucky I have my connection after 3 seconds,
but 8 seconds should suffice for worst case (the first HUP without a sleep
sometimes even succeeded on a slow 486/33 with 8MB RAM, more HUPs don't hurt).

I'm really interested in some more elegant method.

Well, it (natd) _does_ pick up the dynamic address supplied for isp0.
Try 'natd -verbose ...' and you'll see it. Otherwise I agree, there is
certainly something missing in natd's functionality, or maybe sppp
does'nt
supply what it's supposed to ??

> I have to manually send a HUP signal to natd. I do this via the following

YES...super; strange but correct. It works when I send natd a -HUP after
sppp is up. Thanx for the tip. However, natd must be -HUPed _every_ time
sppp has been down (idle timeout) and comes back up!

> I'm really interested in some more elegant method.

So am I, let's see what may come out of the discussion on the list.

In case you want to use switch "-r" noone else _must_ use the tty you redirect
to, you have to remove the getty from the virtual terminal in /etc/ttys and
restart the init process.


6. How do I configure and run the answering machine (under FreeBSD 2.2.x) ?
================================================================================

The answering machine will be activated, when isdnd executes the program
that has been named in "/etc/isdn/isdnd.rc" in the section "telephone
answering" at entry "answerprog = ". If the program is executed
without a pathname, the answer program is expected in "/etc/isdn".
Examples of such programs can be found in "/etc/isdn/samples". They
are named:

	"answer"	answers only, no recording
	"record"	answers, and records messages
	"tell"		the number of the calling person is told,
			no recording.
	"tell-record"	calling number as answer, message is recorded
	"isdntel.sh"	answers and records messages; by using the
			program "isdntel", one has the control over
			the recorded messages in the directory
			"/var/isdn". Look at "man isdntel" and
			"man isdntelctl".

These programs have to be altered to suit your needs. Unfortunately there
is no program with which you can record your answer message. This is not
really bad, because you only have to alter the above mentioned program
"record" a bit (comment out the "if ... fi" statements for the beep
and msg messages). You have to create the directory "/var/isdn" first in
order to record messages. They will be stored in this location then.

7. Teles S0/16.3 ... unknown ?
================================================================================
Hi,

I have just purchased a Teles S0/16.3 card.
But it's not what i4b is looking for .... I mean, it's a different card.

The docs  (and sources)of i4b talks about a Telws S0/16.3 card with 3
address: d80 etc.

This one (is not PnP) has jumpers for 0x180 0x280 0x380.

It has the SIemens Chips numbered PSB 21525 N (HSCX TE V2.1) and PSB
2186N V1.1 (ISAC-S TE).

I undestand that the 16.3c is not supported, but over this board is
written "TELES.S0/16.3 Revision 1.3"

Can anybody tell me what is this card ???

answer:
-------

It's not a different card. The jumpers are documented to select
IO-address 0x180, 0x280 or 0x380 in some TELES manuals.
But in fact they select the addresses 0xd80, 0xe80 or 0xf80.

Wolfgang


And an additional note from Poul-Henning Kamp:
----------------------------------------------
There is an intricate story behind this, in short some ISA cards
only decode the first 10 address bits (0x3ff), which over the years
has resulted in a mutation the "de-facto-spec" such that addressbits
10-15 can be used by the card for selecting various stuff.  This
is extensively used on obscure cards with massive IO needs, sound,
IEEE488 and ISDN cards often belong in this category.



8. How do i integrate a new lowlevel driver into i4b ?
================================================================================

1) Request a flag value from me
2) add an entry for the card into FreeBSD/CONFIG
3) add driver filename to FreeBSD/files.i386.cat
4) add entry for the card to FreeBSD/options.i386.cat
5) add support to print type of card to diehl/diehlctl/main.c
6) add support to print type of card to isdnd/support.c, name_of_controller()
7) place your file as named in 3) into directory layer1
8) add the flag value and function prototypes to layer1/i4b_l1.h
9) add support for NetBSD to layer1/isa_isic.c
10) add support for attach/probe to layer1/i4b_isic.c
11) add card type to i4b/i4b_ioctl.h and update CARD_TYPEP_MAX
12) add an entry to the man page man/isic.4

Produce diffs (please use context diffs, flag "-c" for diff) and send them in.


9. Why it always says "no Space in TX FIFO - State F4 awaiting" ?
================================================================================

as I wrote about two weeks ago I had massive problems concerning this
"no space in TX FIFO"-thing,

/kernel: i4b-L1-ph_data_req: No Space in TX FIFO, state = F4 Awaiting Signal

Even though I used a correctly recognized Teles S0/16.3 nonpnp isdncard,
nothing worked, errormsgs were flooding the console until I rebooted the box.

I decided to play around in the BIOS-settings, I first just set them all
to default, which didn't work, and then changed lots of things - unfortunately
I can't remember them. After about hundreds of trial 'n errors I gave up.

A few days ago I just made another attempt, booted the box and to my surprise
it all worked without the smallest problem, great data rates :)

I tried hard to found what the something special was I changed in the BIOS
settings, but I just couldnt get isdnd back to its stupid behaviour it
showed all the time before, but I would recommend everybody who has this
kind of problem to look into his BIOS.

			(from Meike Aulbach, strange@stoned.rhein-main.de)


i4b now works for me, I had a USB-device interfering on IRQ 9,
which was supposed to be only for my Creatix Card.
(NetBSD 1.3, Creatix)

Strange enough, my DOS s0-test worked, are they just polling the card?

Even when the testsoftware under DOS is working, don't be shure, that
your hw-setup is correct for xxx(x)BSD. Triplecheck all your IRQ and
enable and disable PNP to triple-verify. Even unconfigured devices can
block your card. .....

And that took me more than 2 months to discover :-((((

			(from Andreas Lohrum, andreas.lohrum@consol.de)


when i changed the mainboard of a box that ran i4b alright, i forgot to
set 'used by isa' in the pnp-bios-settings for the irq of my teles
isdn-card. because of that some pci-card got the interrupt that the
isdn-card should have gotten.
i then also got this error: 'No space in TX FIFO'.

The reason occurred to my rather quick, but i would think, that this would
be a nice hint in a FAQ :)

			(from Heiko Schaefer, hschaefer@fto.de)


after my huge amount of problems, Meike's hint (changing the
ISA/PNP-settings in the BIOS) finally fixed things.
I have only tried out this stuff with my Creatix-card, I'll check
out the PNP-stuff with my Sedlbauer-card soon too though.

10. Incoming alert - what does it mean ?
================================================================================

In the log on vty6 (isdnd full screen log) I'm seeing

16.07.98 11:42:35 CHD 00001 rwth rate 90 sec/unit (rate)
16.07.98 11:42:35 CHD 00001 rwth dialing from 4191236 to 441291234
16.07.98 11:42:35 CHD 00001 rwth outgoing call proceeding (ctl 0, ch 0)
16.07.98 11:42:35 CHD 00001 rwth incoming alert  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
16.07.98 11:42:35 CHD 00001 rwth outgoing call active (ctl 0, ch 0)

What does this 'incoming alert' mean?


It means that it is "ringing" at the remote end.


11. How do i change irq's on my teles 16.3 card ?
================================================================================

Question:

So how do you change irq's on your teles 16.3 card (under FBSD or DOS,
I don't have and don't want to have Windows running on that computer) ?

Answer:

The irq is configured into the card each time the driver under whatever
OS you currently boot initializes the card. Thus, change the irq for the
isic driver in your kernel config file to one of the supported (!) irqs
for this card (hint: read "man isic") which is currently unused in your
machine and generate a new kernel.


12. NL: i'm getting CAUSE 100 or CAUSE 101 when dialling out
================================================================================

This one seems to be specific for the Netherlands. (-hm)

Question:

I'm trying to get i4b running on my new FreeBSD 2.2.8 system. The kernel
compiles smootly and everything is looking fine until it's time to dial.
I get the following error:

Feb 10 20:31:00 goofy isdnd[498]: CHD 00018 I4BPPP outgoing call disconnected (remote)
Feb 10 20:31:00 goofy isdnd[498]: CHD 00018 I4BPPP cause 101: Message not compatible with call state (Q.850)

The remote site is a Cisco 4000 type router.  I used debug to take a view at
the ISDN events on the router but according to that the call doesn't arrive
over there.

Same hardware has worked fine with FreeBSD 2.2.6/i4b 0.63.

Who knows what's wrong?


Answer:

This sounds very much like your local phone number or remote phone number
is configured wrongly... in the Netherlands you need to specify the number
EXCLUDING the city code... so if you live in Utrecht and your number is
0301234567 you specify 1234567.

I have seen this in several locations in the Netherlands for years, not
just with i4b, but also with differentt isdn equipment.. why? guess it
simply depends on which operator defines your line or what exchange it
is connected to... :P
What I found is that what solved this with other isdn hardware/software,
also solves it for i4b.. ie.. make sure the local phone number is
specified, and is specified without the city code.
The numbering plan should be 'unknown'

Anyway, it would be nice if the Dutch ptt (they are called KPN btw)
would tell us why this happens... they havent been able to tell me in the
past so I guess I give up on that, but if everyone finds out whats exactly
happening here I'd be interested to know... :)

List of number configurations that I have found to almost always work in
the Netherlands:

1. Local phone number:
   usually your prefered msn without city code works here.
   (ie, 1234567 if you would like to use 0201234567 for outgoing calls)
   on some locations leaving it blank or defining it with the city code,
   but without the leading 0 works as well here.

2. remote phone number:
   When this is a 'local' call, don't specify city code.
   For calling parties in other cities you of cource have to use the city
   code... in general you can say that KPN only accepts the shortest
   possible notation where it would still be clear who you want to call.

3. numbers for incomming call recognition:
   KPN always specifies incoming caller ids with city code, but without
   leading 0. so 0201234567 will be displayed as 201234567


Hope this helps.

14. I'm using sPPP. I can connect to my ISP but no TCP/IP services work. HELP!
==============================================================================

This is probably because you have the RFC1323 - TCP Extensions for High
Performance - support turned on and your ISP (or some router in the loop)
is discarding the extensions.

This can easily be checked by doing ``sysctl net.inet.tcp.rfc1323''. If the
result is 1, then the RFC1323 support is turned on.

Turn this off by doing ``sysctl net.inet.tcp.rfc1323=0'' (This is
called "net.inet.tcp.do_rfc1323" under BSD/OS).

For FreeBSD make sure that tcp_extension="NO" is in your /etc/rc.conf
(/etc/defaults/rc.conf with more recent versions of FreeBSD) and
/etc/rc.conf.local (in -STABLE and upcoming 3.2)

This may be different for NetBSD, OpenBSD and BSD/OS.

Martin Husemann writes:
-----------------------
This does apply for NetBSD too (and probably OpenBSD, since it's been
in NetBSD for a long time). The sysctl name is even compatible ;-) We don't
have a coresponding rc.conf entry, I do it in /etc/netstart.local.

I would suggest to set this to 0 on all machines routed over ISDN (not only
the router), as this "high speed options" in fact do slow down an ISDN link
by making VJ "compression" impossible - as far as I understood it. So there
should be a more general advice in the FAQ, not only "turn it off if it
doesn't work for you".

I've only seen the problems against old linux kernels (about two years ago),
are there still machines out there that have such a broken TCP/IP stack? We
should start to blame the vendors...

15. i4b 0.80.00: problems with AVM Fritz PCI
==============================================================================

Question:
=========

The system is FreeBSD 3.1-RELEASE with i4b-00.80.00-beta-070599 [...]

I'm trying to compile a Kernel with support for my AVM Fritz!PCI card,
however, when compiling, it fails with the following error

The problem appears to be that overinstall.sh does not update files.i386
and options.i386, and that AVM_A1_PCI was added after 3.1-RELEASE and
hence is not defined.

Manually editing these files (using install.sh as a guide) allows the
kernel to compile cleanly.

16. How do i setup logfile rotation for isdnd ?
==============================================================================

For syslog-based logging:
-------------------------

man newsyslog (on FreeBSD)

You just add a line to /etc/newsyslog.conf:
/var/log/isdnd.log      664     7       100     *       Z
and you are all done...

(From: Andreas Haakh <ah@alvman.RoBIN.de>)


For logfile-based logging:
--------------------------

I suggest using newsyslog(8). Adding a line like:

/var/log/isdn.log               664  100   *    168   Z  /var/run/isdnd.pid

to /etc/newsyslog.conf will do the job (here: once a week, for the next
100 weeks) with compression of the old log.

This is the standard method for other daemons (apache, etc.).

I have several customers using sPPP do dial in from their W95/W98/WNT.

If You use FreeBSD_3.2-BETA with i4b-071 or older then you have to apply
the attached patch to /sys/net/if_spppsubr.c (patch -p0 <patchfile).

You need to configure isp0. See the manpages or the supplied templates in
the i4b-distribution. I would suggest to supply an ip-number for the
isp0-interface and force the clients to accept this value.
Don't forget to supply the relevant parameters to sppconfig_isp0 in
/etc/rc.conf...

On WNT you have to install the CAPI-2.0-drivers and Dialin-network.

Create a new entry and check the following box:
* Connection to internet
select the appropriate ISDN-device for dialout, insert a phone-number
and that's it.
You are asked for username & password. Supply the values You did define in
spppconfig_isp0 and dial...

(From: David Wetzel <dave@turbocat.de>)


19. I have lots of old .g711a files to convert what can I do?
================================================================================

Create a shell script (/tmp/csnd.sh) with this contents:
#!/bin/sh

OLDFILES=`ls *.g711a`
#echo $OLDFILES

for THEFILE in $OLDFILES
do
(
        echo -n "converting $THEFILE..."
        BASENAME=`basename $THEFILE .g711a`

        /bin/cat $THEFILE | alaw2ulaw | g711conv -u > $BASENAME.al
        echo "done"
)

done
###### END

then type "chmod a+x /tmp/csnd.sh" in you shell.
cd /usr/local/lib/isdn (or where your old sounds live)
/tmp/csnd.sh
Optional:
rm *.g711a (you should know what you do here :-)

22. How do i enable and configure userland PPP with i4b ?
================================================================================

NOTE: this is the procedure used as of end of July 1999, it may change in
      the near future!

Get the current ppp sources from

	http://www.freebsd.org/~brian

unpack them and apply the patch

	ftp://ftp6.uk.freebsd.org/pub/PPPoISDN/pppcommit.patch

to the ppp directory (where you just unpacked the above mentioned ppp source).
Make and install the result.

Have a look at the user-ppp directory and the end of etc-isdn/isdnd.rc.sample
for ppp and i4b sample configurations to get things up and running.

More information to ppp setup can be found at

	http://www.Awfulhak.org/ppp.html
	http://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/ppp-and-slip.html
	http://www.freebsd.org/doc/faq/ppp.html

and in the directory "user-ppp" of the isdn4bsd distribution.

24. Why do i get "ifconfig: ioctl (SIOCAIFADDR): file exists" ?
================================================================================

Ich ?berlege gerade, aber ich glaube, ich bekomme sie auch.  Das
Problem existiert schon seit geraumer Zeit immer beim Konfigurieren
eines point-to-point Interfaces (SLIP, PPP).

Das `file exists' ist ein Misnomer, es r?hrt daher, da? der
Routingcode die errno's in einer leicht ver?nderten Weise benutzt, so
da? nicht neue errno's daf?r erfunden werden mu?ten.  Lies es als
`route exists'.  (Und falls Du im Zusammenhang mit Routing mal ein `no
such process' siehst, lies es als `no such route'.)

Die Meldung ist harmlos.  Sonst h?tte ich mir schon l?ngst mal die
M?he gemacht, mich durch den ganzen Routing-Code zu hangeln und zu
sehen, warum das passiert.

25. How to properly operate isdnd's fullscreen output in a 132x60 vty
================================================================================

Q: I'm using allscreens_flags="132x60" in /etc/rc.conf but the vty gets
   switched after isdnd is started, so isdnd didn't know about the new
   dimensions of the screen.

A: This one's easy:
   In /etc/rc.isdn change
        isdn_ttype=cons25
   to
        isdn_ttype=cons60l1wide
        /usr/sbin/vidcontrol VESA_132x60 < ${isdn_fsdev}

   The new VESA modes don't have termcap entries yet, so you'll
   have to add one yourself to define 132x60:

   cons60l1wide|cons60-iso8859-1:\
        :co#132:tc=cons60l1:

27. i4b_pci_attach: pci_map_port 1 failed! What does this mean ?
================================================================================

Q: Hi,

   I am trying to set up an ELSA QuickStep 1000pro PCI ISDN adaptor in a FreeBSD
   3.3 box. I configured the kernel according to the i4b.ps documentation. At
   boottime, these messages are displayed:

   isic0: <ELSA QuickStep 1000pro PCI ISDN adaptor> rev 0x01 int a irq 11 on
   pci0.1 7.0
   i4b_pci_attach: pci_map_port 1 failed!

   What does this mean ?, should I be worried ?, will the device function
   properly ?

A: Problem is solved.

   In the BIOS, the PCI slot containing the ISDN card was set to IRQ 14 (having
   no IDE devices). The isic driver finds the card using irq 11 and then says
   "pci_port_map_port failed". The slot is set to IRQ 11 (which was free also)
   and everything works fine here ..
