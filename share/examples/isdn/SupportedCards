7. Notes
========


Note 1:	The driver for the Fritz!Card PnP was developed by Udo Schweigert 
	(ust@cert.siemens.de) who develops under FreeBSD only.
	Please contact Udo in case of trouble.

Note 2:	The NetBSD version has not been verified to work yet.

Note 3: Due to its design, this card produces 128 IRQs/sec. This can be
	reportedly stopped by disconnecting pin 12 of the 7474 and wiring
	it to pin 15 of the 74175. Be careful! This procedure has not been
	verified and doing this will immediately terminate your warranty !!
	The card will not function anymore with drivers for other OSes and
	you may not get any further support from the manufacturer! YMMV!

Note 4: This driver was developed by Hans Petter Selasky, hselasky@c2i.net
        The code is still somewhat experimental.

Note 5: The card has only been verified to work under FreeBSD 4.0 and up.

Note 6: This driver is currently under development by Gary Jennejohn who
	develops under FreeBSD only.

Note 7: This driver is currently under construction by Martin Husemann who
	develops under NetBSD only.

Note 8: This driver is currently under development by Hellmuth Michaelis who
	develops under FreeBSD only.

Note 9: This driver was developed by German Tischler, tanis@gaspode.franken.de.
	Please contact him in case of trouble. The "Teledat 100" sold by the 
	german Telekom is identical with this card.
	
Note 10: This driver is developed by Matthias Apitz, matthias.apitz@sisis.de.
	Please contact him in case of trouble. Please read the file 
	misc/README.PCCARD in the i4b distribution for additional installation
	instructions.

Note 11: This driver was developed by Martijn Plak (martijn@be3.com)
	This driver might also work for Asuscom cards. (Andrew Gordon 
	wrote: Just to let you know that I've now tried the i4b "dynalink"
	driver with the ASUSCOM I-IN100-ST-DV card, and it appears to work
	fine.)

	Note: This driver is now unsupported as Martijn is no longer able
	      to maintain this driver.

	The BSD/OS support for this card was written by Bert Driehuis.

	Ported to FreeBSD newbus by Kazunori Fujiwara <fujiwara@rcac.tdi.co.jp>

Note 12: This driver was developed by Ignatios Souvatzis (is@netbsd.org)
	Please contact him in case of trouble.
	This driver is supposed to work on the ISDN Master versions and
	lookalikes, like the ISDN Blaster, and on the ISDN Master II.
	Note that the ISDN Master II does not AutoConfig(tm)ure in the
	DraCo Zorro bus and thus only works in real Amigas. This is no
	i4b problem, but general.

Note 13: This driver was developed by Martin Husemann, please contact him
	in case of trouble. The FreeBSD PnP support for version 3 of the 
	card was done by Philippe Guezou <Philippe.Guezou@wanadoo.fr>.

Note 14: This driver was developed by Gary Jennejohn who develops under
	FreeBSD only. In case of problems with this driver, please contact
	him directly at garyj@jennejohn.org.

Note 15: The driver for the Siemens I-Surf 2.0 was developed by Udo Schweigert 
	(ust@cert.siemens.de) who develops under FreeBSD only.
	Please contact Udo in case of trouble.

Note 16: The driver for the Asuscom ISDNlink 128K PnP was developed by
	Ari Suutari (ari@suutari.iki.fi). Please contact Ari directly
	in case of trouble with this driver.

Note 17: The driver was written by Juha-Matti Liukkonen <jml@cubical.fi>,
	Cubical Solutions Ltd. I have tested it with an AVM B1 PCI card 
	V.4.0 and an AVM B1 ISA card V.2.0.

Note 18: The driver was written by Juha-Matti Liukkonen <jml@cubical.fi>,
	Cubical Solutions Ltd. I have no access to any PRI equipment at
	all so i have not tested the driver, feedback welcome!
