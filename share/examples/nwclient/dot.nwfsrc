# Example for .nwfsrc file
#
# ncplib lookups configuration files in next order:
#	1. ~/.nwfsrc
#	2. /etc/nwfs.conf - if this file found it will
#	   override values with same keys from user files.
#
#
# This file consist of a set of sections. Each section started by section name
# surrounded by square brackets:
# [section_name]
#
# End of the section marked either by new section or by the end of file.
# Each section can contain zero or more parameters:
# [section_name]
# key=value
#
# where 'key' is a represents parameter name and 'value' a value assigned
# to this parameter.
#
# NetWare library uses next forms of section names:
# [SERVER]
# [SERVER:USER]
# [SERVER:QUEUE]
# 
# When user issues any ncp* command that requires create of new connection
# to a NetWare server, library function lookups for parameters in the 
# corresponding section. First it looks in the [SERVER] section and then in
# the [SERVER:USER] section. Please note that server and user names should be
# in the upper case.
#
