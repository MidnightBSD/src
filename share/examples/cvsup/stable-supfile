# $FreeBSD: release/10.0.0/share/examples/cvsup/stable-supfile 248151 2013-03-11 10:48:26Z bapt $
#
# BEWARE, CVS is deprecated and no longer supported by the FreeBSD project.
#
# The primary development work happens in Subversion and is temporarily
# exported to the legacy CVS system with significant time delays.
#
# You should NOT set up a new consumer of FreeBSD source code via CVS.
# Please see:
# http://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/svn.html
# http://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/svn-mirrors.html
#
# csup (CVS Update Protocol) allows you to download the latest CVS
# tree (or any branch of development therefrom) to your system easily
# and efficiently
#
# To keep your CVS tree up-to-date run:
#
#	csup stable-supfile
#
# Note that this only updates the tree contents and does not
# update what is actually installed.
#
# You may wish to change some of the settings in this file to better
# suit your system:
#
# host=CHANGE_THIS.FreeBSD.org
#		This specifies the server host which will supply the
#		file updates.  You must change it to one of the CVSup
#		mirror sites listed in the FreeBSD Handbook at
#		http://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/cvsup.html#CVSUP-MIRRORS.
#		You can	override this setting on the command line
#		with cvsup's "-h host" option.
#
# base=/var/db
#		This specifies the root where csup will store information
#		about the collections you have transferred to your system.
#		A setting of "/var/db" will generate this information in
#		/var/db/sup.  You can override the "base" setting on the
#		command line with cvsup's "-b base" option.  This directory
#		must exist in order to run CVSup.
#
# prefix=/usr
#		This specifies where to place the requested files.  A
#		setting of "/usr" will place all of the files requested
#		in "/usr/src" (e.g., "/usr/src/bin", "/usr/src/lib").
#		The prefix directory must exist in order to run CVSup.
#

# Defaults that apply to all the collections
#
# IMPORTANT: Change the next line to use one of the CVSup mirror sites
# listed at http://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/cvsup.html#CVSUP-MIRRORS.
*default host=CHANGE_THIS.FreeBSD.org
*default base=/var/db
*default prefix=/usr
# The following line is for 9-stable.  If you want 8-stable, 7-stable,
# 6-stable, 5-stable, 4-stable, 3-stable, or 2.2-stable, change to "RELENG_8",
# "RELENG_7", "RELENG_6", "RELENG_5", "RELENG_4", "RELENG_3", or
# "RELENG_2_2" respectively.
*default release=cvs tag=RELENG_9
*default delete use-rel-suffix

# If you seem to be limited by CPU rather than network or disk bandwidth, try
# commenting out the following line.  (Normally, today's CPUs are fast enough
# that you want to run compression.)
*default compress

## Main Source Tree.
#
# The easiest way to get the main source tree is to use the "src-all"
# mega-collection.  It includes all of the individual "src-*" collections.
# Please note:  If you want to track -STABLE, leave this uncommented.
src-all
