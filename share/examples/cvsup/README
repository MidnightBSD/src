# $FreeBSD: release/10.0.0/share/examples/cvsup/README 248151 2013-03-11 10:48:26Z bapt $

BEWARE, CVS is deprecated and no longer supported by the FreeBSD project.

The primary development work happens in Subversion and is temporarily
exported to the legacy CVS system with significant time delays.

You should NOT set up a new consumer of FreeBSD source code via CVS.
Please see:
http://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/svn.html
http://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/svn-mirrors.html

This directory contains sample "supfiles" for obtaining and updating
the FreeBSD sources via the Internet.  These supfiles will work
with CVSup version 14.0 or later.  For general information on CVSup
itself, please see http://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/cvsup.html

To maintain the sources for the FreeBSD-current release, use:

    standard-supfile		Main source tree

To maintain the sources for the FreeBSD-stable release, use:

    stable-supfile		Main source tree

To maintain a copy of the CVS repository containing all versions of
FreeBSD, use:

    cvs-supfile			Main source tree collection

IMPORTANT: Before you use any of the supfiles in this directory,
you will need to edit in an appropriate "host" setting.  See:

    http://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/mirrors.html

for an up-to-date list of public CVSup mirror sites.

To prevent CVSup from updating particular directories and files, use
this file:
