# $MidnightBSD$

This directory contains sample "supfiles" for obtaining and updating
the MidnightBSD sources via the Internet.  These supfiles will work
with CVSup version 14.0 or later.  For general information on CVSup
itself, please see http://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/cvsup.html

To maintain the sources for the MidnightBSD-current release, use:

    standard-supfile		Main source tree

    mports-supfile		Ports collection

IMPORTANT: Before you use any of the supfiles in this directory,
you will need to edit in an appropriate "host" setting.  See:

    http://www.midnightbsd.org/

for an up-to-date list of public CVSup mirror sites.

To prevent CVSup from updating particular directories and files, use
this file:
