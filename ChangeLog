	* src/context.c: Likewise.

2011-06-19  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	build: don't require perl when building from a tarball
	But do ensure -- in all other circumstances -- that the man/*.1
	files are rebuilt whenever the version number changes.
	* configure.ac (SRC_VERSION_C): Define.
	* man/Makefile.am (dist_man1_MANS): Rename from $(man1_MANS),
	so that we distribute those pesky man/*.1 files.
	(EXTRA_DIST): Reflect name change.
	(MAINTAINERCLEANFILES): Define this, not DISTCLEANFILES,
	now that these generated files are distributed.
	($(dist_man1_MANS)): Depend on $(SRC_VERSION_C), so we get the
	full dependency when not building from a tarball.

2011-06-13  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	doc: do not distribute generated man/*.1 man files
	* man/help2man: New file.
	* man/Makefile.am: Use $(srcdir)/help2man.
	Convert $(dist_man1_MANS) to $(man1_MANS), to tell automake
	not to distribute the generated man/*.1 files.  Now they're
	generated at build-from-tarball time.
	($(man1_MANS)): Depend on version.c, so that man pages are
	regenerated whenever the version string changes.

	build: ccache works better without embedded version strings
	* src/Makefile.am: Generate version.c and version.h and put the
	new symbol in a tiny library to be used by each program.
	(LDADD): Add the new library.
	* src/cmp.c (main): Use Version, not PACKAGE_VERSION, so the .o
	file does not change with each commit-derived version increment.

	* man/diff3.x: New file.
	* man/sdiff.x: New file.
	* man/diff.x: Add xrefs to the other three programs, and to patch.
	* man/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): List new files.
	(cmp.1, diff3.1, sdiff.1): Depend on each .x file.

	doc: rename diff.texi to diffutils.texi
	This makes the .texi basename the same as the package name,
	which is consistent with most other GNU packages.
	* doc/diffutils.texi: Rename from...
	* doc/diff.texi: ...removed.
	* doc/Makefile.am (info_TEXINFOS): Reflect name change.
	(diffutils_TEXINFOS): Likewise.
	* cfg.mk (gendocs_options_): Remove this customization.  It is no
	longer needed, now that the .texi name matches that of the package.
	* man/Makefile.am ($(dist_man1_MANS)): Remove now-unnecessary sed
	filter.
	* README: Update references to diffutils.texi etc. here, too.

	output and slightly edit content.

2011-05-28  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	diff: don't use locales after local-specific sorting fails
	* src/dir.c (compare_names): Don't invoke strcasecmp if
	locale-specific sorting fails, because POSIX.1-2008 says strcasecmp
	has unspecified behavior outside the POSIX locale.  See:
	http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-diffutils/2011-05/msg00008.html

	bootstrap: Avoid multithreading.
	* bootstrap.conf (gnulib_tool_option_extras):
	Add "--avoid=localename --avoid=lock", because we don't want to
	bring in the multithreading code that recent gnulib changes would
	otherwise bring in.
	(excluded_files): Remove m4/lock.m4; no longer needed, now that
	we use --avoid=lock.

	* cfg.mk: Include $(srcdir)/dist-check.mk using "-include",
	to accommodate the new sc_tight_scope rule.
	(_gl_TS_extern): Define, to tell gnulib's tight_scope rule that
	headers here mark externs with "XTERN".
	* gnulib: Update to latest.

2011-05-18  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	of this variable.
	* src/Makefile.am (diff_SOURCES): Move diff.h from here to ...
	(noinst_HEADERS): ...here.
	For convenience, since the tight-scope rule uses $(noinst_HEADERS).

	maint: don't use now-removed gnulib "exit" module
	* bootstrap.conf (gnulib_modules): Remove "exit" module.
	It no longer exists.

2011-03-26  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	($(dist_man1_MANS)): Tell help2man to include diff.x.

	Suggestion from Dan Jacobson in http://bugs.debian.org/613319

2011-03-18  Eric Blake  <eblake@redhat.com>

	docs: info should mention -L

2011-02-15  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	doc: speak of the --test (-a) option, not "the -a or --test option"
	Convert using this command:
	perl -pi -e \
	  's/(\@option{-.}) or (\@option{--.*?}) option/$2 ($1) option/' \
	  doc/diff.texi
	Then convert some more with this:

2011-01-24  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	maint: remove all uses of vfork: use fork instead
	Our use of vfork now provokes warnings from gcc-4.6.0.
	Also, vfork is no longer even specified by POSIX.1-2008.
	* src/diff3.c (read_diff): Change each use of vfork to "fork".
	Remove #ifdef'd code.
	* src/util.c (begin_output, finish_output): Likewise.
	* src/sdiff.c (cleanup, main, edit): Likewise.
	(handler_index_of_SIGPIPE): Remove now-unused definition.
	* src/system.h: Don't include <vfork.h>.
	(vfork): Remove definition.
	* ms/config.site: Remove reference to vfork cache variable.

	tests: avoid newer but less-portable tail option syntax
	* tests/function-line-vs-leading-space: Use sed -n '3,$p' rather than
	tail -n+3.  Older versions of tail do not accept that newer syntax.
	Reported by Sudhakara Peram.

	tests: fix an erroneous test
	On most systems, like-named files were compared, by luck.
	However, on others, different-named files would be compared
	since their names were being treated as equal -- but they had
	different content, so the test would fail.
	* tests/colliding-file-names: Use different sets of file names
	in d1 and d2 so that they cannot accidentally match.
	Put the same line in each test file.  This is required
	when files named e.g., abc and ABC are compared.
	This test was failing on a NixOS 86_64-darwin system.

	build: update gnulib submodule to latest

	maint: update copyright year ranges to include 2011
	Run "make update-copyright", so "make syntax-check" works in 2011.

	build: update gnulib submodule to latest

2010-12-16  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	bootstrap: adjust to recent gnulib changes
	* bootstrap.conf (excluded_files): Do not exclude m4/size_max.m4

	now needed by other gnulib modules.

2010-12-16  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	the old, buggy behavior.

2010-04-16  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	build: update gnulib submodule to latest

	tests: test for the no-newline-at-EOF bug
	* tests/no-newline-at-eof: New file.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add it.

	diff: fix a regression when at least one input lacks a newline-at-EOF,
	and the final hunk plus context-length aligns exactly with the end
	of the newline-lacking file.  Diff would fail to output the required
	"\ No newline at end of file" line, thus rendering the output invalid.
	This bug appears to have been introduced by 2006-05-07
	commit 58d0483b, "(find_identical_ends): Fix huge performance bug...",
	at least to the extent that reverting that change fixes the bug.
	Considering the stated effect of that change and lack of metrics,
	reverting it is not an option, so here we take a more direct approach.

	Given these inputs,

	    printf '\n1'>a; printf '\n0\n\n1'>b

	and running diff like this:

	    ./diff -U1 a b

	for input file "b", the pointer, files[1].linbuf[4][-1], to
	the last byte on the final line was mistakenly pointing at the
	sentinel newline at EOF, rather than at the preceding byte.

	  (gdb) p files[1].linbuf[4][-1]
	  $3 = 10 '\n'

	Thus, this test in the final print_1_line call:

	  if ((!line_flag || line_flag[0]) && limit[-1] != '\n')
	    fprintf (out, "\n\\ %s\n", _("No newline at end of file"));

	would fail, because limit[-1] (which is files[1].linbuf[4][-1])
	was mistakenly '\n', rather than the desired '1'.

	My first thought was simply to adjust the final linbuf[line] setting,
	at the end of io.c's find_and_hash_each_line function function:

	       if (p == bufend)
	-       break;
	+       {
	+         if (current->missing_newline)
	+           --linbuf[line];
	+         break;
	+       }

	But that would make diff misbehave with this input
	(same as above, but with a newline appended to "a"),

	    printf '\n1\n'>a; printf '\n0\n\n1'>b
	    ./diff -U1 a b

	due to the block (100 lines above) that is triggered in that case
	(but not in the both-files-missing-newline case):

	      if (p == bufend
	          && current->missing_newline
	          && ROBUST_OUTPUT_STYLE (output_style))
	        {
	          /* This line is incomplete.  If this is significant,
	             put the line into buckets[-1].  */
	          if (ignore_white_space < IGNORE_SPACE_CHANGE)
	            bucket = &buckets[-1];

	          /* Omit the inserted newline when computing linbuf later.  */
	          p--;
	          bufend = suffix_begin = p;
	        }

	Note how "p" is decremented and "bufend" adjusted.
	When that happens, we certainly don't want to decrement
	"bufend" yet again.

	Since there is no other way to determine at the end whether "bufend"
	was already decremented, add a new variable to serve as witness.

	* src/diff.c (print_context_function): For languages like Ada
	that allow local functions and procedures, the plain context
	function line may start with enough blank characters that the

	these useless initial blank characters.

	maint: change use of "|" to more maintainable "||" (no semantic change)
	* src/analyze.c (diff_2_files): Using the "||" operator happens to
	be equivalent to using "|" in this case.  It is also clearer and

	Patch by Tim Waugh, via Mike Frysinger.

	The new "stdin" test was failing on many types of systems.

	This was introduced via 2009-12-17 commit e58efa5b

	but fortunately is not a bug, because the definition
	it would have overridden was always empty.
