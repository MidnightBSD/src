Unicode/Normalize version 1.03
===================================

Unicode::Normalize - Unicode Normalization Forms

SYNOPSIS

(1) using function names exported by default:

  use Unicode::Normalize;

  $NFD_string  = NFD($string);  # Normalization Form D
  $NFC_string  = NFC($string);  # Normalization Form C
  $NFKD_string = NFKD($string); # Normalization Form KD
  $NFKC_string = NFKC($string); # Normalization Form KC

(2) using function names exported on request:

  use Unicode::Normalize 'normalize';

  $NFD_string  = normalize('D',  $string);  # Normalization Form D
  $NFC_string  = normalize('C',  $string);  # Normalization Form C
  $NFKD_string = normalize('KD', $string);  # Normalization Form KD
  $NFKC_string = normalize('KC', $string);  # Normalization Form KC

INSTALLATION

Perl 5.6.1 or later is required.
Perl 5.8.1 or later is recommended.

To install this module (XSUB: needs a C compiler), type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

If you want to install pure Perl (i.e. no-XSUB),
type the following (!! "disableXS" must run before "Makefile.PL" !!):

   perl disableXS
   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

After building no-XSUB, if you decide to install XSUB,
type the following (!! "enableXS" must run before "Makefile.PL" !!):

   make clean
   perl enableXS
   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires some core modules and pragmas,
and the following files from Unicode Character Database,
which are included in recent perl core distributions.

- unicore/CombiningClass.pl (or unicode/CombiningClass.pl)
- unicore/Decomposition.pl (or unicode/Decomposition.pl)
- unicore/CompositionExclusions.txt (or unicode/CompExcl.txt)

NOTES

(1) After these unicore/*.* files are updated:

In the case of XSUB:
    You must rebuild the module,
    as the data will be compiled on building.

In the case of pure perl:
    Rebuilding is not necessary,
    as the data will be read on requirement.

(2) Normalize.pmN (a pure perl module) may work without any other file
    in this distribution.  It must be renamed Normalize.pm, though.
