This distribution is a replacement for the builtin distribution.

This package contains a selection of subroutines that people have
expressed would be nice to have in the perl core, but the usage would not
really be high enough to warrant the use of a keyword, and the size so
small such that being individual extensions would be wasteful.

After unpacking the distribution, to install this module type
 
        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install

KNOWN BUGS

There is a bug in perl5.6.0 with UV's that are >= 1<<31. This will
show up as tests 8 and 9 of dualvar.t failing
