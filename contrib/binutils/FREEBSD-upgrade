To get a copy of the Binutils source from the Sourceware CVS repository
this command line was used:

	cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@anoncvs.cygnus.com:/cvs/src login
	#	password is "anoncvs"

	cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@anoncvs.cygnus.com:/cvs/src \
		export -r binutils-2_12-branch -l src
	cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@anoncvs.cygnus.com:/cvs/src \
		export -r binutils-2_12-branch \
		src/bfd src/binutils src/config src/etc src/gas src/include \
		src/ld src/libiberty src/opcodes


This corresponds to the binutils-2_12-branch at 21-Feb-2002 14:10 PST.

To strip down a new version of GNU binutils for import (starting with a
checked out copy from the Sourceware anoncvs repo), prune files like this:

	for F in `cat FREEBSD-deletelist`
		do find . -name "$F" -exec rm -rfv {} \; ;
	done

This command should be repeated until no files are shown as being deleted.
(do not eliminate the *z8* files.  They're needed because of a stupid
hard-coded configure script in the opcodes subdirectory)

We need a complete include/elf directory -- even with bits for CPU's we
do not support

	cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@anoncvs.cygnus.com:/cvs/src \
		export -r binutils-2_12-branch src/include/elf


If you decide to bring in more of the files, import them -- do not use
``cvs add''.  And please remember to adjust the contents of "FREEBSD-Xlist"
and "FREEBSD-deletelist" so that it reflects what is really imported from
the vendor.

The vendor import was done by:

	cvs import src/contrib/binutils FSF binutils_2_12_anoncvs_20020221


Note that many of the files generated by GNU configure are present pre-built
in the "src/gnu/usr.bin/binutils" tree.  These can be regenerated for a new
version of binutils by running the "update.sh" script in that directory.

When upgrading to a new version, you also need to update the VERSION
definition in "src/gnu/usr.bin/binutils/Makefile.inc0".

Also, verify that all applicable vendor changes to
contrib/binutils/ld/genscripts.sh are propogated to
src/gnu/usr.bin/binutils/ld/genscripts.sh.
