Whilst a lot of the work in lukemftpd (both the original sources in NetBSD
and this port) was done by me (Luke Mewburn), it would not be as useable
without the enhancements, fixes, or input from the following people:

Christos Zoulas			<christos@netbsd.org>
Curt Sampson			<cjs@netbsd.org>
Jun-ichiro itojun Hagino	<itojun@netbsd.org> 
Matthew R. Green		<mrg@eterna.com.au>
Simon Burge			<simonb@netbsd.org>
Todd Vierling			<tv@netbsd.org>
