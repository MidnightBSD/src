  /* There are two ways to detect cycles.
     The lazy way (which works only with FTS_PHYSICAL),
     with which one may process a directory that is a
     part of the cycle several times before detecting the cycle.
     The `tight' way, whereby fts uses more memory (proportional
     to number of `active' directories, aka distance from root
     of current tree to current directory -- see active_dir_ht)
     to detect any cycle right away.  For example, du must use
     this option to avoid counting disk space in a cycle multiple
     times, but chown -R need not.
     The default is to use the constant-memory lazy way, when possible
     (see below).

     However, with FTS_LOGICAL (when following symlinks, e.g., chown -L)
     using lazy cycle detection is inadequate.  For example, traversing
     a directory containing a symbolic link to a peer directory, it is
     possible to encounter the same directory twice even though there
     is no cycle:
     dir
     ...
     slink -> dir
     So, when FTS_LOGICAL is selected, we have to use a different
     mode of cycle detection: FTS_TIGHT_CYCLE_CHECK.  */
# define FTS_TIGHT_CYCLE_CHECK	0x0100

  /* Use this flag to enable semantics with which the parent
     application may be made both more efficient and more robust.
     Whereas the default is to visit each directory in a recursive
     traversal (via chdir), using this flag makes it so the initial
     working directory is never changed.  Instead, these functions
     perform the traversal via a virtual working directory, maintained
     through the file descriptor member, fts_cwd_fd.  */

  /* Historically, for each directory that fts initially encounters, it would
     open it, read all entries, and stat each entry, storing the results, and

     locality of reference, and also causes trouble with inode-simulating
     file systems like FAT, CIFS, FUSE-based ones, etc., when entries from
     their name/inode cache are flushed too early.
     Use this flag to make fts_open and fts_read defer the stat/lstat/fststat
     of each entry until it actually processed.  However, note that if you use
     this option and also specify a comparison function, that function may not
     examine any data via fts_statp.  */
