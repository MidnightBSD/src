/* A rename wrapper to make tools like mv -- that would normally rely
   on the underlying rename syscall -- work more consistently.
   On at least NetBSD 1.6, `rename ("dir", "B/")' fails when B doesn't
   exist, whereas it succeeds on Linux-2.6.x and Solaris 10.  This wrapper
   provides an interface for systems like the former so that the tools
   (namely mv) relying on the rename syscall have more consistent
   semantics.
