TODO

Features:
* Drill: print appropriate DS RRs (relates to Bug #355)
* ldns-signzone optout to be really optout
* Compression when generating wireformat. Preferably with a configurable 
  policy: refer only backwards, case sensitivity, only refer to other owner 
  names, etc.

Bugfixes:
* Bug #279: fix return values for net.h functions, and related: make return
  values for functions that cannot return memory-failure today. Needs medium
  version increase because of API change.
* Lazy ABI
