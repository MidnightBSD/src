.SH DESCRIPTION
.HP
\fIldns_zone_sort\fR()
Sort the rrs in a zone, with the current impl. this is slow
\.br
\fBzone\fR: the zone to sort
.PP
.HP
\fIldns_zone_glue_rr_list\fR()
Retrieve all resource records from the zone that are glue
records. The resulting list does are pointer references
to the zone's data.

Due to the current zone implementation (as a list of rr's), this
function is extremely slow. Another (probably better) way to do this
is to use an ldns_dnssec_zone structure and the 
ldns_dnssec_mark_and_get_glue() function.

\.br
\fBz\fR: the zone to look for glue
\.br
Returns the rr_list with the glue
