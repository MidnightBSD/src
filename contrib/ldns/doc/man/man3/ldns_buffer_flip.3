.SH DESCRIPTION
.HP
\fIldns_buffer_flip\fR()
makes the buffer ready for reading the data that has been written to
the buffer.  The buffer's limit is set to the current position and
the position is set to 0.

\.br
\fBbuffer\fR: the buffer to flip
\.br
Returns void
.PP
.HP
\fIldns_buffer_rewind\fR()
make the buffer ready for re-reading the data.  The buffer's
position is reset to 0.
\.br
\fBbuffer\fR: the buffer to rewind
.PP
.HP
\fIldns_buffer_position\fR()
returns the current position in the buffer (as a number of bytes)
\.br
\fBbuffer\fR: the buffer
\.br
Returns the current position
.PP
.HP
\fIldns_buffer_set_position\fR()
sets the buffer's position to \%MARK.  The position must be less than
or equal to the buffer's limit.
\.br
\fBbuffer\fR: the buffer
\.br
\fBmark\fR: the mark to use
.PP
.HP
\fIldns_buffer_skip\fR()
changes the buffer's position by \%COUNT bytes.  The position must not
be moved behind the buffer's limit or before the beginning of the
buffer.
\.br
\fBbuffer\fR: the buffer
\.br
\fBcount\fR: the count to use
.PP
