.SH DESCRIPTION
.HP
\fIldns_bget_token\fR()
returns a token/char from the buffer b.
This function deals with ( and ) in the buffer,
and ignores when it finds them.
\.br
\fB*b\fR: the buffer to read from
\.br
\fB*token\fR: the token is put here
\.br
\fB*delim\fR: chars at which the parsing should stop
\.br
\fB*limit\fR: how much to read. If 0 the builtin maximum is used
\.br
Returns s 0 on error of \%EOF of b. Otherwise return the length of what is read
.PP
.HP
\fIldns_bgetc\fR()
returns the next character from a buffer. Advances the position pointer with 1.
When end of buffer is reached returns \%EOF. This is the buffer's equivalent
for getc().
\.br
\fB*buffer\fR: buffer to read from
\.br
Returns \%EOF on failure otherwise return the character
.PP
.HP
\fIldns_bskipcs\fR()
skips all of the characters in the given string in the buffer, moving
the position to the first character that is not in *s.
\.br
\fB*buffer\fR: buffer to use
\.br
\fB*s\fR: characters to skip
\.br
Returns void
