.SH DESCRIPTION
.HP
\fIldns_rr2wire\fR()
Allocates an array of uint8_t at dest, and puts the wireformat of the
given rr in that array. The result_size value contains the
length of the array, if it succeeds, and 0 otherwise (in which case
the function also returns \%NULL)

If the section argument is \%LDNS_SECTION_QUESTION, data like ttl and rdata
are not put into the result

\.br
\fBdest\fR: pointer to the array of bytes to be created
\.br
\fBrr\fR: the rr to convert
\.br
\fBsection\fR: the rr section, determines how the rr is written.
\.br
\fBsize\fR: the size of the converted result
.PP
.HP
\fIldns_pkt2wire\fR()
Allocates an array of uint8_t at dest, and puts the wireformat of the
given packet in that array. The result_size value contains the
length of the array, if it succeeds, and 0 otherwise (in which case
the function also returns \%NULL)

\.br
\fBdest\fR: pointer to the array of bytes to be created
\.br
\fBp\fR: the packet to convert
\.br
\fBsize\fR: the size of the converted result
.PP
.HP
\fIldns_rdf2wire\fR()
Allocates an array of uint8_t at dest, and puts the wireformat of the
given rdf in that array. The result_size value contains the
length of the array, if it succeeds, and 0 otherwise (in which case
the function also returns \%NULL)

\.br
\fBdest\fR: pointer to the array of bytes to be created
\.br
\fBrdf\fR: the rdata field to convert
\.br
\fBsize\fR: the size of the converted result
