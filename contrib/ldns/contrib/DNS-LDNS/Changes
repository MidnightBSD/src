0.50  Sun Mar 30 11:05:23 2014
        - Added prev parameter to the DNS::LDNS::RR::new(str) constructor.
        - Corrected DNS::LDNS::RR::new(file/filename) constructor. Added prev
          parameter, changed the default_ttl and origin parameters to 
          references so they can return data back to the caller as intended.
          Using the 'built-in' default values for ttl and origin, rather than
          my own values.
        - Corrected the DNS::LDNS::Zone::new() constructor. Corrected file
          option for reading zone from stream. Using the 'built-in' default
          values for ttl and origin, rather than my own values.
        - Removed the $DNS::LDNS::DEFAULT_* variables, they proved to be less 
          useful after modifying the Zone and RR constructors.
        - More robust Makefile.PL. Check for existence of ldns library
          and perl modules required for the test suite.
