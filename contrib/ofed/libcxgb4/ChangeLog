    libcxb4: use wc_wmb() instead of wmb().
    
    The user mode RDMA macro for wmb() is not sufficient to provide the
    fencing needed.  This was causing corrupted packets when running multiple
    WD-UDP sockperf processes.  The correct "sfence" instruction is provided
    with the wc_wmb() macro.  See /usr/include/infiniband/arch.h.
    
    Note:  The kernel implementation of wmb() is sufficient.  This is a
    libcxgb4 issue only...

    kernel abi: adds explicit padding in struct c4iw_alloc_ucontext_resp
    
    i386 ABI disagree with most other ABIs regarding alignment
    of data type larger than 4 bytes: on most ABIs a padding must
    be added at end of the structures, while it is not
    required on i386.
    
    Such ABI disagreement will make an x86_64 kernel try to write past
    the struct c4iw_alloc_ucontext_resp buffer provided by an i386
    userspace binary. As struct c4iw_alloc_ucontext_resp is likely
    on stack, see function c4iw_alloc_context(), side effects are
    expected.
    
    On kernel side, this structure was modified for kernel v3.15-rc1
    by following commit:

          cxgb4/iw_cxgb4: Doorbell Drop Avoidance Bug Fixes
    
    If boundary check is implemented on kernel side, the x86_64
    kernel will instead refuse to write past the i386 userspace
    provided buffer and the uverbs will fail.
    
    To fix these issues, this patch adds an explicit padding at end
    of structure so that i386 and others ABI share the same structure
    layout. This patch makes c4iw_alloc_context() check for a value
    in the padding field to detect newer kernel using the field for
    a future purpose (only activated in debug).
    
    With this patch, libcxgb4 will work against older kernel and
    newer patched kernel.

    iw_cxgb4/libcxgb4: swsq "signaled" state needs to mind sq_sig_all.
    
    When a qp is created, the ULP can request that all sq wrs be signaled.
    The swsqe entries need to take this into account when marking the entry
    as signaled.
    
    This bug will cause read request CQEs to be silently discarded, and can
    cause flush problems because the swsqe entry will be mismarked for qps
    created with sq_sig_all set in the qp init attributes.

    never consume a pending wr in sq flush.
    
    There is a race when moving a QP from RTS->CLOSING where a SQ work
    request could be posted after the FW receives the RDMA_RI/FINI WR.
    The SQ work request will never get processed, and should be completed
    with FLUSHED status.  Function c4iw_flush_sq(), however was dropping
    the oldest SQ work request when in CLOSING or IDLE states, instead of
    completing the pending work request. If that oldest pending work request
    was actually complete and has a CQE in the CQ, then when that CQE is
    proceessed in poll_cq, we'll BUG_ON() due to the inconsistent SQ/CQ state.
    
    This is a very small timing hole and has only been hit once so far.
    
    c4iw_flush_sq() MUST always flush all non-completed WRs with FLUSHED
    status regardless of the QP state.

    always do GTS write if cidx_inc == M_CIDXINC.
    
    When polling, we do a GTS update if the accumulated cidx_inc == the cq
    depth / 16.  This works around a T4 bug.  However, if the cq is large
    enough, cq depth / 16 exceeds the size of the field in the GTS word.
    So we also need to update if cidx_inc hits M_CIDXINC to avoid overflowing
    the field.

    fixed bug where sq.udb was getting overwritten.
    
    There was an erroneous statement in create_rc_qp() which caused the
    sq.udb va to be overwritten with the rq.udb va only for on-chip queues.
    This error only affected unmapping of that mapped va when destroying
    a qp.  In the presence of multiple threads creating/destroying qps, the
    erroneously unmapped va could have been assigned to another qp mapping.
    This causes intermittent seg faults as libcxgb4 tries to access memory
    that has been unmapped in error.

    libcxgb4: unmap the correct udb/ugts address.
    
        The various db and gts variables holding the mapped bar2 pointer
        get incremented at creation time as a normal part of object creation.
        However this causes the wrong address to get unmapped when the object is
        destroyed.  The result is a mapping leak because the munmap() fails.
        So align them back to their proper page boundary when calling munmap().

    flush bug can cause application crash
    
    This fixes a problem in the flush logic that could occur if the
    current position is near the end of the queue and the 'count' being
    retired plus this position was greater than the queue size. In this
    case the index wasn't being wrapped and the associated swcqe pointer
    would point past the end of the CQ.
    
    Asserts were added to check other possible wrap-error paths.
    
    This bug was causing mbw to occasionally crash when flushing the qp.

    Silently eat unsignaled read response cqes.
    
    Terminator HW always generates read response cqes.  We need to silently
    eat them vs returning them to the user.  The perftest benchmark ib_read_bw
    relies on unsignaled work requests and will crash with this fix.

    libcxgb4: return -ENOSYS in c4iw_resize_cq().
    
    I fixed a "bug" in c4iw_resize_cq() in an earlier commit which regressed
    us.  c4iw_resize_cq() was returning 0 always even though we don't support
    resizing the CQ.  So I change libcxgb4 to return whatever errno is
    returned by the kernel driver.   However, because the driver didn't set
    the uverbs capabilities for resize_cq, uverbs returned EINVAL.  The OMPI
    code checks for -ENOSYS and handles providers that don't support it.
    If, however, ibv_resize_cq() returns any other error, OMPI bails out.
    So we need to return -ENOSYS.
    
    I didn't see this error, however, running NP192 OMPI/IMB all night long.
    So it must only try to resize for small jobs and thus I missed the
    regression.

    Support variable sized work requests.
    
    T4 EQ entries are in multiples of 64B.  Currently the RDMA SQ and RQ
    use fixed sized entries composed of 4 EQ entries for the SQ and 2 EQ
    entries for the RQ.  For optimial latency with small IO, we need to
    change this so the HW only needs to DMA the EQ entries actually used by
    a given work request.
    
    Implementation:
    
    - add wq_pidx counter to track where we are in the EQ.  cidx/pidx are
    used for the sw sq/rq tracking and flow control.
    
    - the variable part of work requests is the SGL.  Add new functions to
    build the SGL and/or immediate data directly in the EQ memory wrapping
    when needed.
    
    - adjust the min burst size for the EQ contexts to 64B.

    Avoid CQ arm overflows.
    
    There are 2 limits that need to be taken into account when arming the CQ.
    1) the GTS register limits the delta idx to <= M_CIDXINC.
    2) T4 HW limits it to < cq size.
    
    Update t4_arm_cq() to account for these limits.

    Poll fixes.
    
    - when synthesizing CQEs for the SWCQ, always use SQ QID.
    - when flushing, ignore target side read response errors.

    Fix CQ overflow detection.
    
    CQ overflow detection needs to read the gen bit and the timestamp in
    one read operation.  Otherwise false overflows can result.
