Introduction
============

libcxgb4 is a userspace driver for the Chelsio T5 iWARP RNICs.  It works
as a plug-in module for libibverbs that allows programs to use Chelsio
RNICs directly from userspace.  See the libibverbs package for more
information.

Using libcxgb4
===================

libcxgb4 will be loaded and used automatically by programs linked with
libibverbs.  The iw_cxgbe kernel module must be loaded for Chelsio RNIC
devices to be detected and used.

Supported Hardware
==================

libcxgb4 supports the Chelsio T5 family of adapters.
