#  Abstract:
#  	Indent script for source code formatting.
#
#  Environment:
#  	Linux User Mode
#
# This is the indent format used for OpenSM (similar to one used in
# linux/scripts/Lindent).

indent -npro -kr -i8 -ts8 -sob -l80 -ss -ncs "$@"

# indent doesn't have an option for label indentation, so do it with sed
for f in $@ ; do
	test -f $f || continue
	temp=`mktemp -t osm_indent.XXXXXXXX`
	cat $f \
	| sed -e 's/^      \([A-Za-z_]\+[A-Za-z_0-9]*:\)$/\1/' > $temp
	diff $f $temp > /dev/null || cat $temp > $f
	rm -f $temp
done
