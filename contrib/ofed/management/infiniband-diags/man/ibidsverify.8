.TH IBIDSVERIFY 8 "June 1, 2007" "OpenIB" "OpenIB Diagnostics"

.SH NAME
ibidsverify.pl \- validate IB identifiers in subnet and report errors

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ibidsverify.pl
[\-h] [\-R]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
ibidsverify.pl is a perl script which uses a full topology file that was created
by ibnetdiscover, scans the network to validate the LIDs and GUIDs in the
subnet. The validation consists of checking that there are no zero or duplicate
identifiers.

Finally, ibidsverify.pl will also reuse the cached ibnetdiscover output from
some of the other diag tools which makes it a bit faster than running
ibnetdiscover from scratch.

.SH OPTIONS
.PP
.TP
\fB\-R\fR
Recalculate the ibnetdiscover information, ie do not use the cached
information.  This option is slower but should be used if the diag tools have
not been used for some time or if there are other reasons to believe the
fabric has changed.
