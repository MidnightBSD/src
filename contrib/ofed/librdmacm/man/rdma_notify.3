.SH NAME
rdma_notify \- Notifies the librdmacm of an asynchronous event.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "#include <rdma/rdma_cma.h>"
.P
.B "int" rdma_notify
.BI "(struct rdma_cm_id *" id ","
.BI "enum ibv_event_type " event ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "id" 12
RDMA identifier.
.IP "event" 12
Asynchronous event.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Used to notify the librdmacm of asynchronous events that have occurred
on a QP associated with the rdma_cm_id.
.SH "NOTES"
Asynchronous events that occur on a QP are reported through the user's
device event handler.  This routine is used to notify the librdmacm of
communication events.  In most cases, use of this routine is not
necessary, however if connection establishment is done out of band
(such as done through Infiniband), it's possible to receive data on a
QP that is not yet considered connected.  This routine forces the
connection into an established state in this case in order to handle
the rare situation where the connection never forms on its own.
Events that should be reported to the CM are: IB_EVENT_COMM_EST.
