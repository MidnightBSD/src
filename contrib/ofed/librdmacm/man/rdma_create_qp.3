.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "#include <rdma/rdma_cma.h>"
.P
.B "int" rdma_create_qp
.BI "(struct rdma_cm_id *" id ","
.BI "struct ibv_pd *" pd ","
.BI "struct ibv_qp_init_attr *" qp_init_attr ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "id" 12
RDMA identifier.
.IP "pd" 12
protection domain for the QP.
.IP "qp_init_attr" 12
initial QP attributes.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Allocate a QP associated with the specified rdma_cm_id and transition it
for sending and receiving.
.SH "NOTES"
The rdma_cm_id must be bound to a local RDMA device before calling this
function, and the protection domain must be for that same device.
QPs allocated to an rdma_cm_id are automatically transitioned by the
librdmacm through their states.  After being allocated, the QP will be
ready to handle posting of receives.  If the QP is unconnected, it will
be ready to post sends.
