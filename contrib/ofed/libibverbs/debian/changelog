libibverbs (1.0.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

    - For sparc, only generate membar instruction if compiling for V9
      instruction set.  (Closes: #365559)

    - Deprecate some ib_XXX symbol names and introduce ibv_XXX
      replacements for internal consistency.
    - Other minor fixes.
  * Update to Standards-Version: 3.7.2.
