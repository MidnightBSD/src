Package: libibverbs1
Section: libs
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, adduser
Description: A library for direct userspace use of RDMA (InfiniBand/iWARP)
 libibverbs is a library that allows userspace processes to use RDMA
 "verbs" as described in the InfiniBand Architecture Specification and
 the RDMA Protocol Verbs Specification.  iWARP ethernet NICs support
 RDMA over hardware-offloaded TCP/IP, while InfiniBand is a
 high-throughput, low-latency networking technology.  InfiniBand host
 channel adapters (HCAs) and iWARP NICs commonly support direct
 hardware access from userspace (kernel bypass), and libibverbs
 supports this when available.
 .
 For this library to be useful, a device-specific plug-in module
 should also be installed.
 .
 This package contains the shared library.

Description: Development files for the libibverbs library
 libibverbs is a library that allows userspace processes to use RDMA
 "verbs" as described in the InfiniBand Architecture Specification and
 the RDMA Protocol Verbs Specification.  iWARP ethernet NICs support
 RDMA over hardware-offloaded TCP/IP, while InfiniBand is a

 supports this when available.
 .
 This package is needed to compile programs against libibverbs1.
 It contains the header files and static libraries (optionally)
 needed for compiling.

 This package contains the debugging symbols associated with
 libibverbs1. They will automatically be used by gdb for debugging
 libibverbs-related issues.

Description: Examples for the libibverbs library
 libibverbs is a library that allows userspace processes to use RDMA
 "verbs" as described in the InfiniBand Architecture Specification and
 the RDMA Protocol Verbs Specification.  iWARP ethernet NICs support
 RDMA over hardware-offloaded TCP/IP, while InfiniBand is a

 This package contains useful libibverbs1 example programs such as
 ibv_devinfo, which displays information about InfiniBand devices.
