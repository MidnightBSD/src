This is a brief description of the new features and fixes added to
lukemftp-1.5 since the release of lukemftp-1.4.  As always, the manual
page (src/ftp.cat1) is the place to look for complete descriptions.

* Add new commands:
	features	list remote features supported by servers
	mlsd		machine parseable directory listing
	mlst		machine parseable file listing
	remopts		set options on remote features

  These require support in the remote server for the ftp extensions
  described in RFC 2389 and draft-ietf-ftpext-mlst-11.

* Fix support for the --program-prefix and --program-suffix configure
  options.

This is a brief description of the new features and fixes added to
lukemftp-1.4 since the release of lukemftp-1.3.  As always, the manual
page (src/ftp.cat1) is the place to look for complete descriptions.

* Fix compilation problems on various non 4.4BSD derived platforms which
  support IPv6, and on Linux systems which have strdup() as a macro.

* During auto-fetch, don't attempt to autologin a second time if the first
  time failed.

---
This is a brief description of the new features and fixes added to
lukemftp-1.3 since the release of lukemftp-1.2.  As always, the manual
page (src/ftp.cat1) is the place to look for complete descriptions.

* The `ls' command now uses the `LIST' directive instead of `NLST',
  in order to be compatible with RFC959.

* Add fget command, which reads a list of filenames to retrieve from
  the given file.

* Add support for uploading files on the command-line with `ftp -u'.

* Various fixes to the IPv6 support.

This is a brief description of the new features and fixes added to
lukemftp-1.2 since the release of lukemftp-1.1.  As always, the manual
page (src/ftp.cat1) is the place to look for complete descriptions.

* During remote completion, only send ``NLST'' instead of ``NLST .''
  when reading the list of files from the remote server; some servers
  don't like the trailing `.'.

* Support a leading ``[user@]'' for ``[user@]host[:][path]'' auto-fetches
  and ``[user@]host'' connections.

* Always compile in support for setting the type of service on transfers.
  Should speed up transfers on Linux systems.

* Improve performance of non-rate-limited transfers.

* Work around ftp servers that aren't Y2K compliant in returning the
  modification time of a file.

* Update the libedit library to support automatic and magic margins,
  allowing ftp's rprompt to move an extra character to the right.

This is a brief description of the new features and fixes added to
lukemftp-1.1 since the release of lukemftp-1.0.  As always, the manual
page (src/ftp.cat1) is the place to look for complete descriptions.

* Implemented `set prompt' and `set rprompt', which allow you to
  configure the prompt and right side prompt (respectively).
  Some tcsh(1) style `%' escapes are supported, including
  %. %c %/ %m %M %n

* Implemented restarting of file:/// and non-proxied http:// URLs
  (using -R)

* Correctly parse remote ports given as numbers that don't appear in
  the services(5) database.

* Prevent a couple of minor memory leaks

* Add missing compilation setting for SOCKS
