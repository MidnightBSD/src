WHAT IS LUKEMFTP?
-----------------

`lukemftp' is what many users affectionately call the enhanced ftp
client in NetBSD (http://www.netbsd.org).  The `lukem' comes from
the account name of the NetBSD developer who wrote most of the
enhancements: Luke Mewburn <lukem@netbsd.org>.

This package is a `port' of the NetBSD ftp client to other systems.

The enhancements over the standard ftp client in 4.4BSD (and
derivatives) include:
	* command-line editing within ftp
	* command-line fetching of URLS, including support for:
	    - http proxies (c.f: $http_proxy, $ftp_proxy)
	    - authentication
	* configurable prompt
	* context sensitive command and filename completion
	* dynamic progress bar
	* feature negotiation extensions from RFC 2389
	  (c.f: `feat' and `remopts')
	* extensions to ftp from the IETF ftpext working group
	  (c.f: `mlsd' and `mlst')
	* IPv6 support (from the WIDE project)
	* modification time preservation
	* paging of local and remote files, and of directory listings
	  (c.f: `lpage', `page', `pdir')
	* passive mode support, with fallback to active mode
	* retrieval of filenames listed in a given file (c.f: `fget')
	* `set option' override of ftp environment variables
	* socks4/socks5 support
	* TIS Firewall Toolkit gate ftp proxy support (c.f: `gate')
	* transfer-rate throttling (c.f: `-T', `rate')
	* uploading of files on the command line (c.f: `-u')
