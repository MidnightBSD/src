update NEWS, README, ...

at end of configure, show summary of options used and features found

if socks is defined, disable ipv6 and use own getaddrinfo()/getnameinfo()
(for tron)

add locale autoconf checks

AC_CHECK_SIZEOF(off_t, 0) doesn't work on FreeBSD 4.0 because the
test doesn't include <sys/types.h>. fix autoconf?

in configure, check for ansi c compiler and barf if it fails

check if we need #defines for memcpy() et al

check for utimes() decls [which system?]

possibly install editline.3 and editrc.5

system specific tests (to remove need for manual intervention):
- sunos4
	LIBS+= -lresolv
