.Sh LIBRARY
Begemot ATM signalling library
.Pq libngatm, -lngatm
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The Begemot UNI signalling library handles message decoding and encoding as
well as the Q.2110 and Q.2120 transport protocols and adaptation layers, and
ATM-Forum UNI 4.0 compliant signalling.
Because of this complexity the description is broken down in several man pages:
.Bl -tag -width XXXX
.It Xr unimsg 3
Describes a data structure and functions for handling of variable sized
messages.
.It Xr unistruct 3
describes data structures for the decoding, encoding and printing functions
in the library.
.It Xr unifunc 3
describes the decoding, encoding and printing functions.
.\" .It Xr sscop 3
.\" describes the SSCOP transport protocol functions.
.\" .It Xr sscfu 3
.\" describes the SSCF at the UNI functions.
.\" .It Xr uni 3
.\" describes the UNI 4.0 signalling functions.
.It Xr uniaddr 3
describes address structures and handling functions.
.It Xr unisap 3
.\" describes ATM-Forum ATM-API service access point structures and
.\" handling functions.
