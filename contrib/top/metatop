# Top is very sensitive to differences in the kernel, so much so that an
# executable created on one sub-architecture may not work on others.  It
# is also quite common for a minor OS revision to require recompilation of
# top.  Both of these problems are especially prevalent on Suns.  For
# example, a top executable made under SunOS 4.1.1 will not run correctly
# under SunOS 4.1.2, and vice versa.  "metatop" attempts to solve this
# problem by choosing one of several possible top executables to run then
# executing it.
#
# To use metatop your operating system needs to have the command "uname"
# as part of the standard OS release.  MAKE SURE IT DOES before proceeding.
# It will try to execute the command "top-`uname -m`-`uname -r`"  For 
# example, on a sparcstation 1 running SunOS 4.1.1, it will try to run
# "top-sun4c-4.1.1".
#
# INSTALLATION is easy.  Just compile top as normal.  Then use the command
# "make metainstall" (on the same machine!) instead of the usual.  "make"
# will insure that this shell script is installed correctly then will install
# the most recently made top executable with the correct name.  Remember:
# you will need to "make clean" and "make metainstall" on every different
# combination of sub-architecture and OS version that you have.
