You can set the environment-variable DIALOG to whatever program you
want to check. Default is "dialog".

Use "export DIALOG=/usr/bin/dialog" for sh or "setenv DIALOG ../dialog" for csh
to test the /usr/bin/dialog program.

-- Here is the original README for the samples directory.

There is no documentation at the moment for cdialog 0.9a, but here are a 
small installer (copismall) for 'points' fido-like, that uses cdialog 0.9a.
It can demonstrate some of the new features... run "copismall" paying 
attention because after asking for some things, it then installs and/or
configures programs like as Inn, Ifmail, Smail to make the 'point'. 
It's in Italian language only at moment, but the code is bash......
If you want look at other much professional products FREE realized with 
cdialog and that use much of the other new characteristics, look for one of
the ComeOn Point Suites v1.1+. Makers are a sub-group of the ComeOn Linux
Development Team... ComeOn Linux! follows GNU philosophy.

Mail demarco_p@abramo.it to have the actual location of these Suites and 
of other free ComeOn Linux! software, or if you want more info about 
ComeOn Linux!

To run the "ComeOn Point Installer! v0.9a.small", type:
