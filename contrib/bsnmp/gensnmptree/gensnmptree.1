.Sh NAME
.Nm gensnmptree
.Nd "generate C and header files from a MIB description file"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl helt
.Op Fl p Ar prefix
.Op Ar name Ar ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is used to either generate C language tables and header files from
a MIB description or to numeric OIDs from MIB descriptions.
The first form is used only for maintaining the
.Xr bsnmpd 1
daemon or for module writers.
The second form may be used by SNMP client program writers.
.Pp
If the
.Fl e
option is not used
.Nm
reads a MIB description from its standard input and creates two files: a
C-file
.Ar prefix Ns tree.c
containing a table used by
.Xr bsnmpd 1
during PDU processing
and a header file
.Ar prefix Ns tree.h
containing appropriate declarations of the callback functions used in this table
and the table itself.
.Pp
If the
.Fl e
option is specified
.Nm
expects MIB variable names (only the last component) on its command line.
It reads a MIB specification from standard input and for each MIB variable
name emits three C preprocessor defines on its standard output:
.Bl -tag -width ".Va OIDLEN_ Ns Ar Name"
.It Va OIDX_ Ns Ar name
This define can be used to initialize a
.Va struct asn_oid
in the following way:
.Pp
.Dl const struct asn_oid oid_sysDescr = OIDX_sysDescr;
.It Va OIDLEN_ Ns Ar name
is the length of the OID.
.It Va OID_ Ns Ar name
is the last component of the OID.
.El
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width ".Fl d Ar argument"
.It Fl h
Print a short help page.
.It Fl e
Enter extract mode.
.It Fl l
Generate local preprocessor includes.
This is used for bootstrapping
.Xr bsnmpd 1 .
.It Fl t
Instead of normal output print the resulting tree.
.It Fl p Ar prefix
Prefix the file names and the table name with
.Ar prefix .
.El
.Sh MIBS
The syntax of the MIB description file can formally be specified as follows:
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
file := tree | tree file

tree := head elements ')'

entry := head ':' index STRING elements ')'

leaf := head TYPE STRING ACCESS ')'

column := head TYPE ACCESS ')'

head := '(' INT STRING

elements := EMPTY | elements element

element := tree | leaf

index := TYPE | index TYPE
.Ed
.Pp
.Ar TYPE
specifies a SNMP data type and may be one of
.Bl -bullet -offset indent -compact
.It
NULL
.It
INTEGER
.It
INTEGER32 (same as INTEGER)
.It
UNSIGNED32 (same as GAUGE)
.It
OCTETSTRING
.It
IPADDRESS
.It
OID
.It
TIMETICKS
.It
COUNTER
.It
GAUGE
.It
COUNTER64
.El
.Pp
.Ar ACCESS
specifies the accessibility of the MIB variable (which operation can be
performed) and is one of
.Bl -bullet -offset indent -compact
.It
GET
.It
SET
.El
.Pp
.Ar INT
is a decimal integer and
.Ar STRING
is any string starting with a letter or underscore and consisting of
letters, digits and underscores, that is not one of the keywords.
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following MIB description describes the system group:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
(1 internet
  (2 mgmt
    (1 mibII
      (1 system
        (1 sysDescr OCTETSTRING op_system_group GET)
        (2 sysObjectId OID op_system_group GET)
        (3 sysUpTime TIMETICKS op_system_group GET)
        (4 sysContact OCTETSTRING op_system_group GET SET)
        (5 sysName OCTETSTRING op_system_group GET SET)
        (6 sysLocation OCTETSTRING op_system_group GET SET)
        (7 sysServices INTEGER op_system_group GET)
        (8 sysORLastChange TIMETICKS op_system_group GET)
        (9 sysORTable
          (1 sysOREntry : INTEGER op_or_table
            (1 sysORIndex INTEGER)
            (2 sysORID OID GET)
            (3 sysORDescr OCTETSTRING GET)
            (4 sysORUpTime TIMETICKS GET)
        ))
