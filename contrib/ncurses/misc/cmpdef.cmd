 * cmpdef.cmd - compares two .def files, checking whether they have
 *		the same entries with the same export codes.
 *
 * returns 0 if there are no conflicts between the files -- that is,
 * the newer one can replace the older one.
 *
 * returns 1 when either of the files is not properly formatted and
 * when there are conflicts: two symbols having the same export code.
 *
 * the standard output shows a list with newly added symbols, plus
 * replaced symbols and conflicts.
