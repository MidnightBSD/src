The 'tack' program is a diagnostic that is designed to create and
verify the correctness of terminfo's.  This program can be used to
create new terminal descriptions that are not included in the standard
release.  Although 'tack' is distributed with ncurses, it is not an
integral part of ncurses.  It may be removed from the release without
limiting the usefulness of ncurses on those terminals described in the
terminfo data base.  The best way to remove 'tack' from the build is
to delete or rename the 'tack' directory before running the configure
script.

Unlike most of ncurses the 'tack' program is covered under the GNU
Public License.
