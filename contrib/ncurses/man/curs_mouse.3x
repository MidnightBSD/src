.SH DESCRIPTION
These functions provide an interface to mouse events from
\fBncurses\fR(3X).
Mouse events are represented by \fBKEY_MOUSE\fR
pseudo-key values in the \fBwgetch\fR input stream.

To make mouse events visible, use the \fBmousemask\fR function.
This will set
the mouse events to be reported.
By default, no mouse events are reported.
The function will return a mask to indicate which of the specified mouse events
can be reported; on complete failure it returns 0.
If oldmask is non-NULL,
this function fills the indicated location with the previous value of the given
window's mouse event mask.

As a side effect, setting a zero mousemask may turn off the mouse pointer;
setting a nonzero mask may turn it on.
Whether this happens is device-dependent.

Here are the mouse event type masks:

.TE

Once a class of mouse events have been made visible in a window,
calling the \fBwgetch\fR function on that window may return
\fBKEY_MOUSE\fR as an indicator that a mouse event has been queued.
To read the event data and pop the event off the queue, call
\fBgetmouse\fR.
This function will return \fBOK\fR if a mouse event
is actually visible in the given window, \fBERR\fR otherwise.
When \fBgetmouse\fR returns \fBOK\fR, the data deposited as y and
x in the event structure coordinates will be screen-relative character-cell
coordinates.
The returned state mask will have exactly one bit set to
indicate the event type.

The \fBungetmouse\fR function behaves analogously to \fBungetch\fR.
It pushes
a \fBKEY_MOUSE\fR event onto the input queue, and associates with that event
the given state data and screen-relative character-cell coordinates.

The \fBwenclose\fR function tests whether a given pair of screen-relative
character-cell coordinates is enclosed by a given window, returning TRUE
if it is and FALSE otherwise.
It is useful for determining what subset of
the screen windows enclose the location of a mouse event.

The \fBwmouse_trafo\fR function transforms a given pair of coordinates from
stdscr-relative coordinates to screen-relative coordinates or vice versa.
Please remember, that stdscr-relative coordinates are not always identical
to screen-relative coordinates due to the mechanism to reserve lines on top
or bottom of the screen for other purposes (ripoff() call, see also slk_...
functions).
If the parameter \fBto_screen\fR is \fBTRUE\fR, the pointers 
\fBpY, pX\fR must reference the coordinates of a location inside the window 
\fBwin\fR.
They are converted to screen-relative coordinates and returned
through the pointers.
If the conversion was successful, the function returns \fBTRUE\fR.
If one of the parameters was NULL or the location is
not inside the window, \fBFALSE\fR is returned.
If \fBto_screen\fR is
\fBFALSE\fR, the pointers \fBpY, pX\fR must reference screen-relative
coordinates.
They are converted to stdscr-relative coordinates if the
window \fBwin\fR encloses this point.
In this case the function returns \fBTRUE\fR.
If one of the parameters is NULL or the point is not inside the
window, \fBFALSE\fR is returned.
Please notice, that the referenced coordinates
are only replaced by the converted coordinates if the transformation was
successful.
 
The \fBmouseinterval\fR function sets the maximum time (in thousands of a
second) that can elapse between press and release events for them to
be recognized as a click.
Use \fBmouseinterval(-1)\fR to disable click resolution.
This function returns the previous interval value.
The default is one sixth of a second.

Note that mouse events will be ignored when input is in cooked mode, and will
cause an error beep when cooked mode is being simulated in a window by a
function such as \fBgetstr\fR that expects a linefeed for input-loop
termination.

.SH RETURN VALUE
\fBgetmouse\fR, \fBungetmouse\fR and \fBmouseinterval\fR
return the integer \fBERR\fR upon failure or \fBOK\fR
upon successful completion.
\fBmousemask\fR returns the
mask of reportable events.
\fBwenclose\fR and \fBwmouse_trafo\fR
are boolean functions returning \fBTRUE\fR or \fBFALSE\fR depending
on their test result.
.SH PORTABILITY
These calls were designed for \fBncurses\fR(3X), and are not found in SVr4
curses, 4.4BSD curses, or any other previous version of curses.

The feature macro \fBNCURSES_MOUSE_VERSION\fR is provided so the preprocessor
can be used to test whether these features are present (its value is 1).
If the interface is changed, the value of \fBNCURSES_MOUSE_VERSION\fR will be
incremented.

The order of the \fBMEVENT\fR structure members is not guaranteed.
Additional fields may be added to the structure in the future.

Under \fBncurses\fR(3X), these calls are implemented using either
xterm's built-in mouse-tracking API or Alessandro Rubini's gpm server.
If you are using something other than xterm and there is no gpm daemon
running on your machine, mouse events will not be visible to
\fBncurses\fR(3X) (and the \fBwmousemask\fR function will always
return \fB0\fR).

The z member in the event structure is not presently used.
It is intended
for use with touch screens (which may be pressure-sensitive) or with
3D-mice/trackballs/power gloves.
.SH BUGS
Mouse events under xterm will not in fact be ignored during cooked mode,
if they have been enabled by \fBwmousemask\fR.
Instead, the xterm mouse
report sequence will appear in the string read.

Mouse events under xterm will not be detected correctly in a window with
its keypad bit off, since they are interpreted as a variety of function key.
Your terminfo description must have \fBkmous\fR set to "\\E[M" (the beginning
of the response from xterm for mouse clicks).

Because there are no standard terminal responses that would serve to identify
terminals which support the xterm mouse protocol, \fBncurses\fR assumes that
if your $TERM environment variable contains "xterm",
or \fBkmous\fR is defined in
the terminal description, then the terminal may send mouse events.
