.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBunctrl\fR routine returns a character string which is a printable
representation of the character \fIc\fR, ignoring attributes.
Control characters are displayed in the \fB^\fR\fIX\fR notation.
Printing characters are displayed as is.
The corresponding \fBwunctrl\fR returns a printable representation of
a wide-character.

The \fBkeyname\fR routine returns a character string corresponding to the key \fIc\fR.
Control characters are displayed in the \fB^\fR\fIX\fR notation.
Values above 128 are either meta characters, shown in the \fBM-\fR\fIX\fR notation,
or the names of function keys, or
"UNKNOWN STRING".
The corresponding \fBkey_name\fR returns a character string corresponding
to the wide-character value \fIw\fR.
The two functions do not return the same set of strings;
the latter returns "UNKNOWN STRING" where the former would display a meta character.

The \fBfilter\fR routine, if used, must be called before \fBinitscr\fR or
\fBnewterm\fR are called.  The effect is that, during those calls, \fBLINES\fR
is set to 1; the capabilities \fBclear\fR, \fBcup\fR, \fBcud\fR, \fBcud1\fR,
\fBcuu1\fR, \fBcuu\fR, \fBvpa\fR are disabled; and the \fBhome\fR string is
set to the value of \fBcr\fR.

The \fBuse_env\fR routine, if used, is called before \fBinitscr\fR or
\fBnewterm\fR are called.  When called with \fBFALSE\fR as an
argument, the values of \fBlines\fR and \fBcolumns\fR specified in the
\fIterminfo\fR database will be used, even if environment variables
\fBLINES\fR and \fBCOLUMNS\fR (used by default) are set, or if
\fBcurses\fR is running in a window (in which case default behavior
would be to use the window size if \fBLINES\fR and \fBCOLUMNS\fR are
not set).

The \fBputwin\fR routine writes all data associated with window \fIwin\fR into
the file to which \fIfilep\fR points.  This information can be later retrieved
using the \fBgetwin\fR function.

The \fBgetwin\fR routine reads window related data stored in the file by
\fBputwin\fR.  The routine then creates and initializes a new window using that
data.  It returns a pointer to the new window.

The \fBdelay_output\fR routine inserts an \fIms\fR millisecond pause
in output.  This routine should not be used extensively because
padding characters are used rather than a CPU pause.

The \fBflushinp\fR routine throws away any typeahead that has been typed by the
user and has not yet been read by the program.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Except for \fBflushinp\fR, routines that return an integer return \fBERR\fR
upon failure and \fBOK\fR (SVr4 specifies only "an integer value other than
\fBERR\fR") upon successful completion.

\fBflushinp\fR always returns \fBOK\fR.

Routines that return pointers return \fBNULL\fR on error.
.SH PORTABILITY
The XSI Curses standard, Issue 4 describes these functions.
It states that \fBunctrl\fR and \fBwunctrl\fR will return a null pointer if
unsuccessful, but does not define any error conditions.

The SVr4 documentation describes the action of \fBfilter\fR only in the vaguest
terms.  The description here is adapted from the XSI Curses standard (which
erroneously fails to describe the disabling of \fBcuu\fR).
