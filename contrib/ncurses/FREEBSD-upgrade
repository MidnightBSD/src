ncurses

	The release tarball can be found at GNU FTP sites.
	The beta version can be found at ftp://invisible-island.net/ncurses/
	or ftp://dickey.his.com/ncurses/

For the import files and directories were pruned by:

	tar -X FREEBSD-Xlist -zxf ncurses-5.6.tar.gz

check if there are any new bits that we don't want.

then imported by:

	cvs import -m 'Import ncurses 5.6-20061217 onto the vendor branch' \
		src/contrib/ncurses NCURSES v5_6_20061217

The date in the tag can be obtained from contrib/ncurses/dist.mk.

To make local changes to ncurses, simply patch and commit to the main
branch (aka HEAD).  Never make local changes on the vendor (NCURSES) branch.

All local changes should be submitted to Thomas Dickey for inclusion in
the next vendor release. The author is very willing to help us.

After importing, you have to update files in lib/ncurses. To configure
ncurses, go to /usr/ports/devel/ncurses and

	make WITHOUT_TERMINFO=1 configure

Update ncurses_cfg.h and necessary Makefile glues from ${WRKSRC}/build.nowidec.
Directory for wide character support is ${WRKSRC}/build.widec
You may have to update ncurses-specific glue in termcap.c.

Current local changes:

ncurses/tinfo/comp_scan.c
  rev 1.2: native termcap tweaking

ncurses/tinfo/lib_baudrate.c
  rev 1.2: switch to contemporary TTY interface

ncurses/tinfo/lib_termcap.c
  rev 1.2: native termcap tweaking
  rev 1.4: remove GCC_UNUSED for rev 1.2

ncurses/tinfo/read_termcap.c
  This is not used. We have our own src/lib/ncurses/termcap.c
