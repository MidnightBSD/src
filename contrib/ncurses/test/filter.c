/*
 * An example of the 'filter()' function in ncurses, this program prompts
 * for commands and executes them (like a command shell).  It illustrates
 * how ncurses can be used to implement programs that are not full-screen.
 *
 * Ncurses differs slightly from SVr4 curses.  The latter does not flush its
 * state when exiting program mode, so the attributes on the command lines of
 * this program 'bleed' onto the executed commands.  Rather than use the
 * reset_shell_mode() and reset_prog_mode() functions, we could invoke endwin()
 * and refresh(), but that does not work any better.
