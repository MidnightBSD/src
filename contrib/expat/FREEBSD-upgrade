eXpat from www.libexpat.org

v2.0.1:

This directory contains the virgin sources for the import of the
expat XML processing library, trimmed of the bits realted to other
platforms (the trimmed contents are listed below).

Imported via:
  1) Upacking sources
  2) cd expat-2.0.1, remove the listed files below
  3) cvs import -ko src/contrib/expat EXPAT v2_0_1

The docs say that I should add this FREEBSD-upgrade separately, as
a "cvs add / cvs ci" operation, which is what I have done (but it
differs from the processed used for the 1.95.5 import).
