libarchive

The source code is pulled with git:

	git clone git://github.com/libarchive/libarchive.git

For the contrib directory files and directories were pruned by:
	
sh -c 'for F in `cat MIDNIGHTBSD-Xlist | grep -v MidnightBSD`; do rm -rf ./$F ; done'

To make local changes to libarchive, simply patch and commit to the trunk
branch (aka HEAD).  Never make local changes on the vendor branch.
