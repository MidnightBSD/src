.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm Pf-spacing
.Nd spacing around the prefix macro
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Closing punctuation goes
.Pf . right .
But
.Pf . . double
prefixes don't work.
Opening punctuation goes
.Pf ( left .
But again, prefix
.Pf ( ) pairs
don't work.
Even normal text gets
.Pf pre fixed .
The first
.Pf Ar gument
is not parsed.
Nothing can be
.Pf prefixed
to the next line.
Trailing punctuation still counts as
.Em eos Pf .
.Po But it does not fall out of enclosures Pf . Pc
.Pp
It makes no sense at the very
.Em end Pf
