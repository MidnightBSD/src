     One single echo(1) is fine, and so is an echo(1) followed by something
     _e_l_s_e.

     But listen for multiple echo(1)s.

     A call, an (echo(1)), and another echo(1).

     Finally, an (echo(1)) without a blank, half an echo, no blank after half
     an echo, no echo and no echo at all.
