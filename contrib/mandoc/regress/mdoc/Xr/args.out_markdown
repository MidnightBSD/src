XR-ARGS(1) - General Commands Manual

# NAME

**Xr-args** - additional arguments to cross references

# DESCRIPTION

One single
echo(1)
is fine, and so is an
echo(1) followed by something *else*.

But listen for multiple
echo(1)s.

A call, an
(echo(1)), and
another
echo(1).

Finally, an
(echo(1))
without a blank, half an
echo,
no blank after half an
echo,
no echo
and no
echo at all.
