     This is a long line of text, such that the last word won't fit: break-
     here

     But do not break the line at hyphens inside macro arguments: no
     break-here

     Try the same thing once same again, but now in italic font mode: _b_r_e_a_k_-
     _h_e_r_e

     And finally, try it a third time, but this time in bold font mode: bbrreeaakk--
