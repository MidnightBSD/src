.Nm if-before-Dd
.Nd end of if block on its own line before Dd
.Sh DESCRIPTION
In an old version of
.Xr mandoc 1 ,
.Xr mdoc 7
file format autodetection failed when the end of an
.Ic if
block stood on its own line before the initial
.Xr mdoc 7
.Ic Dd
macro.
The file was mishandled as
.Xr man 7
and parsing failed with unknown macro errors.
.Pp
If the present document looks like a proper
.Xr mdoc 7
document and the following display reads
.Dq mytext ,
then the problem did not come back:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
\*[mystring]
.Ed
