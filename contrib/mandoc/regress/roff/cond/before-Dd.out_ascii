DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     In an old version of mandoc(1), mdoc(7) file format autodetection failed
     when the end of an iiff block stood on its own line before the initial
     mdoc(7) DDdd macro.  The file was mishandled as man(7) and parsing failed
     with unknown macro errors.

     If the present document looks like a proper mdoc(7) document and the
     following display reads "mytext", then the problem did not come back:

           mytext
