			  Installing OpenPAM
			  ==================

1. REQUIREMENTS

  See the release notes for a list of platforms OpenPAM has been
  tested on.

  You will need the GNU autotools, GNU make and the GNU compiler suite
  to build OpenPAM.  On some platforms, you may have to install these
  separately.

2. CONFIGURATION

  Use the "configure" shell script to configure OpenPAM for your
  system.  Options include:

    --with-modules-dir=DIR
	Indicates the directory where PAM modules will be installed.
	This option should not be used if you intend to install PAM
	modules in the system library directory.

    --with-pam-su
	Builds the sample PAM application.

    --with-pam-unix
	Builds the sample PAM module.

  For more information about configuration options, use the --help
  option.

  A typical invocation might look like this:

  # ./configure --with-pam-su --with-pam-unix

3. COMPILATION

  To compile OpenPAM, simply run "make" (or "gmake" on platforms where
  "make" is not GNU make) in the top-level OpenPAM directory:

  # make

4. INSTALLATION

  To install OpenPAM, simply run "make install" (or "gmake install" on
  platforms where "make" is not GNU make) in the top-level OpenPAM
  directory:

  # make install

$P4: //depot/projects/openpam/INSTALL#4 $
