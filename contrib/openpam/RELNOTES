		 Release notes for OpenPAM Hydrangea
		 ===================================

This release corresponds to the code used in FreeBSD-CURRENT as of the
release date.  It has also been tested on several other platforms, and
is expected to work on almost any POSIX-like platform that has GNU
autotools, GNU make and the GNU compiler suite installed.  One notable
exception is MacOS X, which ships with a very weird, heavily modified
version of GCC.

The library itself is complete.  Documentation exists in the form of
man pages for the library functions.  These man pages are generated by
a Perl script from specially marked-up comments in the source files
themselves, which minimizes the chance that any of them should be out
of date.

The distribution also includes three sample modules (pam_deny,
pam_permit and pam_unix) and a sample application (su).  These are not
intended for actual use, but rather to serve as examples for module or
application developers.

NOTE: to the person who sent me MacOS patches in July 2002: I have
lost your name and email address.  Please contact me so I can give you
proper credit for your contribution.
