Known bugs in sudo version 1.6.8
================================

1) Sudo should have an option to log when removing "dangerous"
   environment variables.

2) On DUNIX in sia mode, hitting return at the prompt does not quit.

3) In parse.lex, '@' should not need to be a special character.
   However, because lex does greedy matching, {WORD} will match
   instead of the "^Defaults[:@]?" line.

4) In list mode (sudo -l), characters escaped with a backslash
   are shown verbatim with the backslash.

5) Because the parser only does a single pass it is possible to
   make a sudoers file where the "defaults" options are set after
   a user's entry has been validated, changing the permissions for
   the user.  The work-around is to put all 'defaults' entries
   before the "User privilege specification" section but after all
   the "alias specifications".  In the future the parser will
   converted to a two-pass parser.

6) For the same reason as #5, changing the value of "ignore_dot" has
   no effect (find_path() is called before sudoers is parsed).

For a list of things that are not bugs but that I would like to
add / fix, please see the TODO file.
