What's new in Sudo 1.7.2?

 * A new #includedir directive is available in sudoers.  This can be
   used to implement an /etc/sudo.d directory.  Files in an includedir
   are not edited by visudo unless they contain a syntax error.

 * The -g option did not work properly when only setting the group
   (and not the user).  Also, in -l mode the wrong user was displayed
   for sudoers entries where only the group was allowed to be set.

 * Fixed a problem with the alias checking in visudo which
   could prevent visudo from exiting.

 * Sudo will now correctly parse the shell-style /etc/environment
   file format used by pam_env on Linux.

 * When doing password and group database lookups, sudo will only
   cache an entry by name or by id, depending on how the entry was
   looked up.  Previously, sudo would cache by both name and id
   from a single lookup, but this breaks sites that have multiple
   password or group database names that map to the same uid or
   gid.

 * User and group names in sudoers may now be enclosed in double
   quotes to avoid having to escape special characters.

 * BSM audit fixes when changing to a non-root uid.

 * Experimental non-Unix group support.  Currently only works with
   Quest Authorization Services and allows Active Directory groups
   fixes for Minix-3.

 * For Netscape/Mozilla-derived LDAP SDKs the certificate and key
   paths may be specified as a directory or a file.  However, version
   5.0 of the SDK only appears to support using a directory (despite
   documentation to the contrary).  If SSL client initialization
   fails and the certificate or key paths look like they could be
   default file name, strip off the last path element and try again.

 * A setenv() compatibility fix for Linux systems, where a NULL
   value is treated the same as an empty string and the variable
   name is checked against the NULL pointer.

What's new in Sudo 1.7.1?

 * A new Defaults option "pwfeedback" will cause sudo to provide visual
   feedback when the user is entering a password.

 * A new Defaults option "fast_glob" will cause sudo to use the fnmatch()
   function for file name globbing instead of glob().  When this option
   is enabled, sudo will not check the file system when expanding wildcards.
   This is faster but a side effect is that relative paths with wildcard
   will no longer work.

 * New BSM audit support for systems that support it such as FreeBSD
   and Mac OS X.

 * The file name specified with the #include directive may now include
   a %h escape which is expanded to the short form of hostname.

 * The -k flag may now be specified along with a command, causing the
   user's timestamp file to be ignored.

 * New support for Tivoli-based LDAP START_TLS, present in AIX.

 * New support for /etc/netsvc.conf on AIX.

 * The unused alias checks in visudo now handle the case of an alias
   referring to another alias.

What's new in Sudo 1.7.0?

 * Rewritten parser that converts sudoers into a set of data structures.
   This eliminates a number of ordering issues and makes it possible to
   apply sudoers Defaults entries before searching for the command.
   It also adds support for per-command Defaults specifications.

 * Sudoers now supports a #include facility to allow the inclusion of other
   sudoers-format files.

 * Sudo's -l (list) flag has been enhanced:
    o applicable Defaults options are now listed
    o a command argument can be specified for testing whether a user
      may run a specific command.
    o a new -U flag can be used in conjunction with "sudo -l" to allow
      root (or a user with "sudo ALL") list another user's privileges.

 * A new -g flag has been added to allow the user to specify a
   primary group to run the command as.  The sudoers syntax has been
   extended to include a group section in the Runas specification.

 * A uid may now be used anywhere a username is valid.

 * The "secure_path" run-time Defaults option has been restored.

 * Password and group data is now cached for fast lookups.

 * The file descriptor at which sudo starts closing all open files is now
   configurable via sudoers and, optionally, the command line.

 * Visudo will now warn about aliases that are defined but not used.

 * The -i and -s command line flags now take an optional command
   to be run via the shell.  Previously, the argument was passed
   to the shell as a script to run.

 * Improved LDAP support.  SASL authentication may now be used in
   conjunction when connecting to an LDAP server.  The krb5_ccname
   parameter in ldap.conf may be used to enable Kerberos.

 * Support for /etc/nsswitch.conf.  LDAP users may now use nsswitch.conf
   to specify the sudoers order.  E.g.:
	sudoers: ldap files
   to check LDAP, then /etc/sudoers.  The default is "files", even
   when LDAP support is compiled in.  This differs from sudo 1.6
   where LDAP was always consulted first.

 * Support for /etc/environment on AIX and Linux.  If sudo is run
   with the -i flag, the contents of /etc/environment are used to
   populate the new environment that is passed to the command being
   run.

 * If no terminal is available or if the new -A flag is specified,
   sudo will use a helper program to read the password if one is
   configured.  Typically, this is a graphical password prompter
   such as ssh-askpass.

 * A new Defaults option, "mailfrom" that sets the value of the
   "From:" field in the warning/error mail.  If unspecified, the
   login name of the invoking user is used.

 * A new Defaults option, "env_file" that refers to a file containing
   environment variables to be set in the command being run.

 * A new flag, -n, may be used to indicate that sudo should not
   prompt the user for a password and, instead, exit with an error
   if authentication is required.

 * If sudo needs to prompt for a password and it is unable to disable
   echo (and no askpass program is defined), it will refuse to run
   unless the "visiblepw" Defaults option has been specified.

 * Prior to version 1.7.0, hitting enter/return at the Password: prompt
   would exit sudo.  In sudo 1.7.0 and beyond, this is treated as
   an empty password.  To exit sudo, the user must press ^C or ^D
   at the prompt.

 * visudo will now check the sudoers file owner and mode in -c (check)
   mode when the -s (strict) flag is specified.

 * A new Defaults option "umask_override" will cause sudo to set the
   umask specified in sudoers even if it is more permissive than the
   invoking user's umask.
