Notes on upgrading from an older release
========================================

o Upgrading from a version prior to 1.6.8:

    Prior to sudo 1.6.8, if /var/run did not exist, sudo would put
    the timestamp files in /tmp/.odus.  As of sudo 1.6.8, the
    timestamp files will be placed in /var/adm/sudo or /usr/adm/sudo
    if there is no /var/run directory.  This directory will be
    created if it does not already exist.

    Previously, a sudoers entry that explicitly prohibited running
    a command as a certain user did not override a previous entry
    allowing the same command.  This has been fixed in sudo 1.6.8
    such that the last match is now used (as it is documented).
    Hopefully no one was depending on the previous (buggy) beghavior.

o Upgrading from a version prior to 1.6:

    As of sudo 1.6, parsing of runas entries and the NOPASSWD tag
    has changed.  Prior to 1.6, a runas specifier applied only to
    a single command directly following it.  Likewise, the NOPASSWD
    tag only allowed the command directly following it to be run
    without a password.  Starting with sudo 1.6, both the runas
    specifier and the NOPASSWD tag are "sticky" for an entire
    command list.  So, given the following line in sudo < 1.6

	millert ALL=(daemon) NOPASSWD:/usr/bin/whoami,/bin/ls

    millert would be able to run /usr/bin/whoami as user daemon
    without a password and /bin/ls as root with a password.

    As of sudo 1.6, the same line now means that millert is able
    to run run both /usr/bin/whoami and /bin/ls as user daemon
    without a password.  To expand on this, take the following
    example:

	millert ALL=(daemon) NOPASSWD:/usr/bin/whoami, (root) /bin/ls, \
	    /sbin/dump

    millert can run /usr/bin/whoami as daemon and /bin/ls and
    /sbin/dump as root.  No password need be given for either
    command.  In other words, the "(root)" sets the default runas
    user to root for the rest of the list.  If we wanted to require
    a password for /bin/ls and /sbin/dump the line could be written
    thusly:

	millert ALL=(daemon) NOPASSWD:/usr/bin/whoami, \
	    (root) PASSWD:/bin/ls, /sbin/dump

    Additionally, sudo now uses a per-user timestamp directory
    instead of a timestamp file.  This allows tty timestamps to
    simply be files within the user's timestamp dir.  For the
    default, non-tty case, the timestamp on the directory itself
    is used.

    Also, the temporary file used by visudo is now /etc/sudoers.tmp
    since some versions of vipw on systems with shadow passwords use
    /etc/stmp for the temporary shadow file.

o Upgrading from a version prior to 1.5:

    By default, sudo expects the sudoers file to be mode 0440 and
    to be owned by user and group 0.  This differs from version 1.4
    and below which expected the sudoers file to be mode 0400 and
    to be owned by root.  Doing a `make install' will set the sudoers
    file to the new mode and group.  If sudo encounters a sudoers
    file with the old permissions it will attempt to update it to
    the new scheme.  You cannot, however, use a sudoers file with
    the new permissions with an old sudo binary.  It is suggested
    that if have a means of distributing sudo you distribute the
    new binaries first, then the new sudoers file (or you can leave
    sudoers as is and sudo will fix the permissions itself as long
    as sudoers is on a local file system).
