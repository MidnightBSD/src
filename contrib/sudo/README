This is Sudo version 1.6.8

The sudo philosophy
===================
Sudo is a program designed to allow a sysadmin to give limited root privileges
to users and log root activity.  The basic philosophy is to give as few
privileges as possible but still allow people to get their work done.

Where to find sudo
==================
Before you try and build sudo, *please* make sure you have the current
version.  The latest sudo may always be gotten via anonymous ftp
from ftp.sudo.ws in the directory /pub/sudo/.
The distribution is sudo-M.m.tar.gz where `M' is the major
version number and `m' is the minor version number.
BETA versions of sudo may also be available.  If you join
the `sudo-workers' mailing list you will get the BETA announcements
(see the `Mailing lists' section below).

What's new
==========
For a history of sudo please see the HISTORY file that came with this
release.

For a complete list of changes, see the CHANGES file.  For a summary,
see the web page, http://www.sudo.ws/sudo/.

If you are upgrading from an earlier version of Sudo, please see
the UPGRADE file.

NOTE: Starting with sudo 1.5.7 the configuration method has changed
      significantly as compared to previous versions.  All options
      are now set via the configure script.  See the `INSTALL' file
      for a list of all the configure options.

System requirements
===================
To build sudo from the source distribution you need a machine running
UN*X (most flavors of BSD, SYSV, or POSIX will do), a working C
compiler, and the make utility.

If you wish to modify the parser then you will need flex version
2.5.2 or later and either bison or byacc (sudo comes with a pre-flex'd
tokenizer and pre-yacc'd grammar parser).  You'll also have to
uncomment a few lines from the Makefile or run configure with the
--with-devel option.  You can get flex via anonymous ftp from
ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov/pub/flex* as well as any GNU mirror.  You can
get GNU bison from ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/bison/ or any GNU
mirror.
