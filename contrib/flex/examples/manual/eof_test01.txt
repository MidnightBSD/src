This is test file #1

-------------------------------------------------

We will now include test #2 in a standard way.

#include "eof_test02.txt"

-------------------------------------------------

And now we will include test # 2 with a different
format

#include "eof_test02.txt"
-------------------------------------------------

and this is the end of the test.
