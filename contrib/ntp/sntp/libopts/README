        THIS TARBALL IS NOT A FULL DISTRIBUTION.

The contents of this tarball is designed to be incorporated into
software packages that utilize the AutoOpts option automation
package and are intended to be installed on systems that may not
have libopts installed.  It is redistributable under the terms
of either the LGPL (see COPYING.lgpl) or under the terms of
the advertising clause free BSD license (see COPYING.mbsd).

Usage Instructions for autoconf/automake/libtoolized projects:

1. Install the unrolled tarball into your package source tree,
   copying ``libopts.m4'' to your autoconf macro directory.

   In your bootstrap (pre-configure) script, you can do this:

      rm -rf libopts libopts-*
      gunzip -c `autoopts-config libsrc` | tar -xvf -
      mv -f libopts-*.*.* libopts
      cp -fp libopts/m4/*.m4 m4/.

   I tend to put my configure auxiliary files in "m4".
   Whatever directory you choose, if it is not ".", then
   be sure to tell autoconf about it with:

      AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR(m4)

   This is one macro where you *MUST* remember to *NOT* quote
   the argument.  If you do, automake will get lost.

2. Add the following to your ``configure.ac'' file:

      LIBOPTS_CHECK

   or:

      LIBOPTS_CHECK([relative/path/to/libopts])

   This macro will automatically invoke

      AC_CONFIG_FILES( [relative/path/to/libopts/Makefile] )

   The default ``relative/path/to/libopts'' is simply
   ``libopts''.

3. Add the following to your top level ``Makefile.am'' file:

      if NEED_LIBOPTS
         SUBDIRS += $(LIBOPTS_DIR)
      endif

   where ``<...>'' can be whatever other files or directories
   you may need.  The SUBDIRS must be properly ordered.
   *PLEASE NOTE* it is crucial that the SUBDIRS be set under the
   control of an automake conditional.  To work correctly,
   automake has to know the range of possible values of SUBDIRS.
   It's a magical name with magical properties.  ``NEED_LIBOPTS''
   will be correctly set by the ``LIBOPTS_CHECK'' macro, above.

4. Add ``$(LIBOPTS_CFLAGS)'' to relevant compiler flags and
   ``$(LIBOPTS_LDADD)'' to relevant link options whereever
   you need them in your build tree.

5. Make sure your object files explicitly depend upon the
   generated options header file.  e.g.:

     $(prog_OBJECTS) : prog-opts.h
     prog-opts.h : prog-opts.c
     prog-opts.c : prog-opts.def
         autogen prog-opts.def

6. *OPTIONAL* --
   If you are creating man pages and texi documentation from
   the program options, you will need these rules somewhere, too:

     man_MANS = prog.1
     prog.1 : prog-opts.def
         autogen -Tagman1.tpl -bprog prog-opts.def

     prog-invoke.texi : prog-opts.def
         autogen -Taginfo.tpl -bprog-invoke prog-opts.def

If your package does not utilize the auto* tools, then you
will need to hand craft the rules for building the library.
