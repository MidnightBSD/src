/*
 * ISC Application Support
 *
 * Dealing with program termination can be difficult, especially in a
 * multithreaded program.  The routines in this module help coordinate
 * the shutdown process.  They are used as follows by the initial (main)
 * thread of the application:
 *
 *		isc_app_start();	Call very early in main(), before
 *					any other threads have been created.
 *
 *		isc_app_run();		This will post any on-run events,
 *					and then block until application
 *					shutdown is requested.  A shutdown
 *					request is made by calling
 *					isc_app_shutdown(), or by sending
 *					SIGINT or SIGTERM to the process.
 *					After isc_app_run() returns, the
 *					application should shutdown itself.
 *
 *		isc_app_finish();	Call very late in main().
 *
 * Applications that want to use SIGHUP/isc_app_reload() to trigger reloading
 * should check the result of isc_app_run() and call the reload routine if
 * the result is ISC_R_RELOAD.  They should then call isc_app_run() again
 * to resume waiting for reload or termination.
 *
 * Use of this module is not required.  In particular, isc_app_start() is
 * NOT an ISC library initialization routine.
 *
 * MP:
 *	Clients must ensure that isc_app_start(), isc_app_run(), and
 *	isc_app_finish() are called at most once.  isc_app_shutdown()
 *	is safe to use by any thread (provided isc_app_start() has been
 *	called previously).
 *
 * Reliability:
 *	No anticipated impact.
 *
 * Resources:
 *	None.
 *
 * Security:
 *	No anticipated impact.
 *
 * Standards:
 *	None.
