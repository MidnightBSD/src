	The
	[= prog-name =]
	utility program is used to query an NTP daemon about its
	current state and to request changes in that state.
	It uses NTP mode 7 control message formats described in the source code.
	The program may
	be run either in interactive mode or controlled using command line
	arguments.
	Extensive state and statistics information is available
	through the
	[= prog-name =]
	interface.
	In addition, nearly all the
	configuration options which can be specified at startup using
	ntpd's configuration file may also be specified at run time using
	[= prog-name =] .
