NTP 4.2.4p8 (Harlan Stenn <stenn@ntp.org>, 2009/12/08)

Focus: Security Fixes

Severity: HIGH

This release fixes the following high-severity vulnerability:

* [Sec 1331] DoS with mode 7 packets - CVE-2009-3563.

  See http://support.ntp.org/security for more information.

  NTP mode 7 (MODE_PRIVATE) is used by the ntpdc query and control utility.
  In contrast, ntpq uses NTP mode 6 (MODE_CONTROL), while routine NTP time
  transfers use modes 1 through 5.  Upon receipt of an incorrect mode 7
  request or a mode 7 error response from an address which is not listed
  in a "restrict ... noquery" or "restrict ... ignore" statement, ntpd will
  reply with a mode 7 error response (and log a message).  In this case:

	* If an attacker spoofs the source address of ntpd host A in a
	  mode 7 response packet sent to ntpd host B, both A and B will
	  continuously send each other error responses, for as long as
	  those packets get through.

	* If an attacker spoofs an address of ntpd host A in a mode 7
	  response packet sent to ntpd host A, A will respond to itself
	  endlessly, consuming CPU and logging excessively.

  Credit for finding this vulnerability goes to Robin Park and Dmitri
  Vinokurov of Alcatel-Lucent.

THIS IS A STRONGLY RECOMMENDED UPGRADE.

NTP 4.2.4p7 (Harlan Stenn <stenn@ntp.org>, 2009/05/04)

Focus: Security and Bug Fixes

Severity: HIGH

This release fixes the following high-severity vulnerability:

* [Sec 1151] Remote exploit if autokey is enabled.  CVE-2009-1252

  See http://support.ntp.org/security for more information.

  If autokey is enabled (if ntp.conf contains a "crypto pw whatever"
  line) then a carefully crafted packet sent to the machine will cause
  a buffer overflow and possible execution of injected code, running
  with the privileges of the ntpd process (often root).

  Credit for finding this vulnerability goes to Chris Ries of CMU.

This release fixes the following low-severity vulnerabilities:

* [Sec 1144] limited (two byte) buffer overflow in ntpq.  CVE-2009-0159
  Credit for finding this vulnerability goes to Geoff Keating of Apple.
  
* [Sec 1149] use SO_EXCLUSIVEADDRUSE on Windows
  Credit for finding this issue goes to Dave Hart.

This release fixes a number of bugs and adds some improvements:

* Improved logging
* Fix many compiler warnings
* Many fixes and improvements for Windows
* Adds support for AIX 6.1
* Resolves some issues under MacOS X and Solaris

THIS IS A STRONGLY RECOMMENDED UPGRADE.

NTP 4.2.4p6 (Harlan Stenn <stenn@ntp.org>, 2009/01/07)

Focus: Security Fix

Severity: Low

This release fixes oCERT.org's CVE-2009-0021, a vulnerability affecting
the OpenSSL library relating to the incorrect checking of the return
value of EVP_VerifyFinal function.

Credit for finding this issue goes to the Google Security Team for
finding the original issue with OpenSSL, and to ocert.org for finding
the problem in NTP and telling us about it.

This is a recommended upgrade.

NTP 4.2.4p5 (Harlan Stenn <stenn@ntp.org>, 2008/08/17)

Focus: Minor Bugfixes 

This release fixes a number of Windows-specific ntpd bugs and 
platform-independent ntpdate bugs. A logging bugfix has been applied
to the ONCORE driver.

The "dynamic" keyword and is now obsolete and deferred binding to local 
interfaces is the new default. The minimum time restriction for the 
interface update interval has been dropped. 

A number of minor build system and documentation fixes are included. 

This is a recommended upgrade for Windows.

NTP 4.2.4p4 (Harlan Stenn <stenn@ntp.org>, 2007/09/10)

Focus: Minor Bugfixes

This release updates certain copyright information, fixes several display
bugs in ntpdc, avoids SIGIO interrupting malloc(), cleans up file descriptor
shutdown in the parse refclock driver, removes some lint from the code,
stops accessing certain buffers immediately after they were freed, fixes
a problem with non-command-line specification of -6, and allows the loopback
interface to share addresses with other interfaces.

NTP 4.2.4p3 (Harlan Stenn <stenn@ntp.org>, 2007/06/29)

Focus: Minor Bugfixes

This release fixes a bug in Windows that made it difficult to
terminate ntpd under windows.
This is a recommended upgrade for Windows.

NTP 4.2.4p2 (Harlan Stenn <stenn@ntp.org>, 2007/06/19)

Focus: Minor Bugfixes

This release fixes a multicast mode authentication problem, 
an error in NTP packet handling on Windows that could lead to 
ntpd crashing, and several other minor bugs. Handling of 
multicast interfaces and logging configuration were improved. 
The required versions of autogen and libopts were incremented.
This is a recommended upgrade for Windows and multicast users.

NTP 4.2.4 (Harlan Stenn <stenn@ntp.org>, 2006/12/31)

Focus: enhancements and bug fixes.

Dynamic interface rescanning was added to simplify the use of ntpd in 
conjunction with DHCP. GNU AutoGen is used for its command-line options 
processing. Separate PPS devices are supported for PARSE refclocks, MD5 
signatures are now provided for the release files. Drivers have been 
added for some new ref-clocks and have been removed for some older 
ref-clocks. This release also includes other improvements, documentation 
and bug fixes. 

K&R C is no longer supported as of NTP-4.2.4. We are now aiming for ANSI 
C support.
