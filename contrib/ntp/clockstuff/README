README file for directory ./clockstuff of the NTP Version 4 distribution

This directory contains the sources for utility programs designed to
support radio clocks. The chutest.c and clktest.c are desgined to
test the chu_clk and tty_clk line disciplines and STREAMS modules in
the ../kernel directory.

These files have been modified to work with either the line disciplines
or the STREAMS modules. Be sure to define -DSTREAM if appropriate.

These are random bits of things written to help with clocks.  You can
make things in here by typing one or more of:

	make propdelay (or `make')
	make chutest
	make clktest

Propdelay computes high frequency propagation delays, given the
longitude and latitude of the transmitter and receiver.  Use
this for WWV/H and CHU.  Don't use it for WWVB (the computation
is easier for that).

Chutest can be used to input and process data from a CHU modem
attached to a serial port.  It will use the CHU line discipline
(if installed), or raw mode otherwise.  This was used to test
out the initial reduction algorithms, and may not be up to date.

Clktest can be used to test the clock line discipline (CLKLDISC,
it must be available), and to take a look at radio clocks attached to a
serial port.
