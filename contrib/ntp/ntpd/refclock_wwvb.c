/*
 * This driver supports the Spectracom Model 8170 and Netclock/2 WWVB
 * Synchronized Clocks and the Netclock/GPS Master Clock. Both the WWVB
 * and GPS clocks have proven reliable sources of time; however, the
 * WWVB clocks have proven vulnerable to high ambient conductive RF
 * interference. The claimed accuracy of the WWVB clocks is 100 us
 * relative to the broadcast signal, while the claimed accuracy of the
 * GPS clock is 50 ns; however, in most cases the actual accuracy is
 * limited by the resolution of the timecode and the latencies of the
 * serial interface and operating system.
 *
 * The WWVB and GPS clocks should be configured for 24-hour display,
 * AUTO DST off, time zone 0 (UTC), data format 0 or 2 (see below) and
 * baud rate 9600. If the clock is to used as the source for the IRIG
 * Audio Decoder (refclock_irig.c in this distribution), it should be
 * configured for AM IRIG output and IRIG format 1 (IRIG B with
 * signature control). The GPS clock can be configured either to respond
 * to a 'T' poll character or left running continuously. 
 *
 * There are two timecode formats used by these clocks. Format 0, which
 * is available with both the Netclock/2 and 8170, and format 2, which
 * is available only with the Netclock/2, specially modified 8170 and
 * GPS.
 *
 * Format 0 (22 ASCII printing characters):
 *
 * <cr><lf>i  ddd hh:mm:ss  TZ=zz<cr><lf>
 *
 *	on-time = first <cr>
 *	hh:mm:ss = hours, minutes, seconds
 *	i = synchronization flag (' ' = in synch, '?' = out of synch)
 *
 * The alarm condition is indicated by other than ' ' at a, which occurs
 * during initial synchronization and when received signal is lost for
 * about ten hours.
 *
 * Format 2 (24 ASCII printing characters):
 *
 * <cr><lf>iqyy ddd hh:mm:ss.fff ld
 *
 *	on-time = <cr>
 *	i = synchronization flag (' ' = in synch, '?' = out of synch)
 *	q = quality indicator (' ' = locked, 'A'...'D' = unlocked)
 *	yy = year (as broadcast)
 *	ddd = day of year
 *	hh:mm:ss.fff = hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds
 *
 * The alarm condition is indicated by other than ' ' at a, which occurs
 * during initial synchronization and when received signal is lost for
 * about ten hours. The unlock condition is indicated by other than ' '
 * at q.
 *
 * The q is normally ' ' when the time error is less than 1 ms and a
 * character in the set 'A'...'D' when the time error is less than 10,
 * 100, 500 and greater than 500 ms respectively. The l is normally ' ',
 * but is set to 'L' early in the month of an upcoming UTC leap second
 * and reset to ' ' on the first day of the following month. The d is
 * set to 'S' for standard time 'I' on the day preceding a switch to
 * daylight time, 'D' for daylight time and 'O' on the day preceding a
 * switch to standard time. The start bit of the first <cr> is
 * synchronized to the indicated time as returned.
 *
 * This driver does not need to be told which format is in use - it
 * figures out which one from the length of the message.The driver makes
 * no attempt to correct for the intrinsic jitter of the radio itself,
 * which is a known problem with the older radios.
 *
 * Fudge Factors
 *
 * This driver can retrieve a table of quality data maintained
 * internally by the Netclock/2 clock. If flag4 of the fudge
 * configuration command is set to 1, the driver will retrieve this
 * table and write it to the clockstats file on when the first timecode
 * message of a new day is received.
