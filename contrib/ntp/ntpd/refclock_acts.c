/*
 * This driver supports the NIST Automated Computer Time Service (ACTS).
 * It periodically dials a prespecified telephone number, receives the
 * NIST timecode data and calculates the local clock correction. It is
 * designed primarily for use as a backup when neither a radio clock nor
 * connectivity to Internet time servers is available. For the best
 * accuracy, the individual telephone line/modem delay needs to be
 * calibrated using outside sources.
 *
 * The ACTS is located at NIST Boulder, CO, telephone 303 494 4774. A
 * toll call from a residence telephone in Newark, DE, costs between 14
 * and 27 cents, depending on time of day, and from a campus telephone
 * between 3 and 4 cents, although it is not clear what carrier and time
 * of day discounts apply in this case. The modem dial string will
 * differ depending on local telephone configuration, etc., and is
 * specified by the phone command in the configuration file. The
 * argument to this command is an AT command for a Hayes compatible
 * modem.
 *
 * The accuracy produced by this driver should be in the range of a
 * millisecond or two, but may need correction due to the delay
 * characteristics of the individual modem involved. For undetermined
 * reasons, some modems work with the ACTS echo-delay measurement scheme
 * and some don't. This driver tries to do the best it can with what it
 * gets. Initial experiments with a Practical Peripherals 9600SA modem
 * here in Delaware suggest an accuracy of a millisecond or two can be
 * achieved without the scheme by using a fudge time1 value of 65.0 ms.
 * In either case, the dispersion for a single call involving ten
 * samples is about 1.3 ms.
 *
 * The driver can operate in either of three modes, as determined by
 * the mode parameter in the server configuration command. In mode 0
 * (automatic) the driver operates continuously at intervals depending
 * on the prediction error, as measured by the driver, usually in the
 * order of several hours. In mode 1 (backup) the driver is enabled in
 * automatic mode only when no other source of synchronization is
 * available and when more than MAXOUTAGE (3600 s) have elapsed since
 * last synchronized by other sources. In mode 2 (manual) the driver
 * operates only when enabled using a fudge flags switch, as described
 * below.
 *
 * For reliable call management, this driver requires a 1200-bps modem
 * with a Hayes-compatible command set and control over the modem data
 * terminal ready (DTR) control line. Present restrictions require the
 * use of a POSIX-compatible programming interface, although other
 * interfaces may work as well. The modem setup string is hard-coded in
 * the driver and may require changes for nonstandard modems or special
 * circumstances.
 *
 * Further information can be found in the README.refclock file in the
 * ntp - Version 3 distribution.
 *
 * Fudge Factors
 *
 * Ordinarily, the propagation time correction is computed automatically
 * by ACTS and the driver. When this is not possible or erratic due to
 * individual modem characteristics, the fudge flag2 switch should be
 * set to disable the ACTS echo-delay scheme. In any case, the fudge
 * time1 parameter can be used to adjust the propagation delay as
 * required.
 *
 * The ACTS call interval is determined in one of three ways. In manual
 * mode a call is initiated by setting fudge flag1 using ntpdc, either
 * manually or via a cron job. In AUTO mode this flag is set by the peer
 * timer, which is controlled by the sys_poll variable in response to
 * measured errors. In backup mode the driver is ordinarily asleep, but
 * awakes (in auto mode) if all other synchronization sources are lost.
 * In either auto or backup modes, the call interval increases as long
 * as the measured errors do not exceed the value of the fudge time2
 * parameter.
 *
 * When the fudge flag1 is set, the ACTS calling program is activated.
 * This program dials each number listed in the phones command of the
 * configuration file in turn. If a call attempt fails, the next number
 * in the list is dialed. The fudge flag1 and counter are reset and the
 * calling program terminated if (a) a valid clock update has been
 * determined, (b) no more numbers remain in the list, (c) a device
 * fault or timeout occurs or (d) fudge flag1 is reset manually using
 * ntpdc.
 *
 * In automatic and backup modes, the driver determines the call
 * interval using a procedure depending on the measured prediction
 * error and the fudge time2 parameter. If the error exceeds time2 for a
 * number of times depending on the current interval, the interval is
 * decreased, but not less than about 1000 s. If the error is less than
 * time2 for some number of times, the interval is increased, but not
 * more than about 18 h. With the default value of zero for fudge time2,
 * the interval will increase from 1000 s to the 4000-8000-s range, in
 * which the expected accuracy should be in the 1-2-ms range. Setting
 * fudge time2 to a large value, like 0.1 s, may result in errors of
 * that order, but increase the call interval to the maximum. The exact
 * value for each configuration will depend on the modem and operating
 * system involved, so some experimentation may be necessary.

 *
 * UTC = Universal Time Coordinated, the official world time referred to
 * the zero meridian.
 *
 * DST	Daylight savings time characters, valid for the continental
 *	U.S., are set as follows:
 *
 *	00	We are on standard time (ST).
 *	01-49	Now on DST, go to ST when your local time is 2:00 am and
 *		the count is 01. The count is decremented daily at 00
 *		(UTC).
 *	50	We are on DST.
 *	51-99	Now on ST, go to DST when your local time is 2:00 am and
 *		the count is 51. The count is decremented daily at 00
 *		(UTC).
 *
 *	The two DST characters provide up to 48 days advance notice of a
 *	change in time. The count remains at 00 or 50 at other times.
 *
 * LS	Leap second flag is set to "1" to indicate that a leap second is
 *	to be added as 23:59:60 (UTC) on the last day of the current UTC
 *	month. The LS flag will be reset to "0" starting with 23:59:60
 *	(UTC). The flag will remain on for the entire month before the
 *	second is added. Leap seconds are added as needed at the end of
 *	any month. Usually June and/or December are chosen.
 *
 *	The leap second flag will be set to a "2" to indicate that a
 *	leap second is to be deleted at 23:59:58--00:00:00 on the last
 *	day of the current month. (This latter provision is included per
 *	international recommendation, however it is not likely to be
 *	required in the near future.)
 *
 * DUT1	Approximate difference between earth rotation time (UT1) and
 *	UTC, in steps of 0.1 second: DUT1 = UT1 - UTC.
 *
 * MJD	Modified Julian Date, often used to tag certain scientific data.
 *
 * The full time format is sent at 1200 baud, 8 bit, 1 stop, no parity.
 * The format at 300 Baud is also 8 bit, 1 stop, no parity. At 300 Baud
 * the MJD and DUT1 values are deleted and the time is transmitted only
 * on even seconds.
 *
 * Maximum on line time will be 56 seconds. If all lines are busy at any
 * time, the oldest call will be terminated if it has been on line more
 * than 28 seconds, otherwise, the call that first reaches 28 seconds
 * will be terminated.
 *
 * Current time is valid at the "on-time" marker (OTM), either "*" or
 * "#". The nominal on-time marker (*) will be transmitted 45 ms early
 * to account for the 8 ms required to send 1 character at 1200 Baud,
 * plus an additional 7 ms for delay from NIST to the user, and
 * approximately 30 ms "scrambler" delay inherent in 1200 Baud modems.
 * If the caller echoes all characters, NIST will measure the round trip
 * delay and advance the on-time marker so that the midpoint of the stop
 * bit arrives at the user on time. The amount of msADV will reflect the
 * actual required advance in milliseconds and the OTM will be a "#".
 *
 * (The NIST system requires 4 or 5 consecutive delay measurements which
 * are consistent before switching from "*" to "#". If the user has a
 * 1200 Baud modem with the same internal delay as that used by NIST,
 * then the "#" OTM should arrive at the user within +-2 ms of the
 * correct time.
 *
 * However, NIST has studied different brands of 1200 Baud modems and
 * found internal delays from 24 ms to 40 ms and offsets of the "#" OTM
 * of +-10 ms. For many computer users, +-10 ms accuracy should be more
 * than adequate since many computer internal clocks can only be set
 * with granularity of 20 to 50 ms. In any case, the repeatability of
 * the offset for the "#" OTM should be within +-2 ms, if the dial-up
 * path is reciprocal and the user doesn't change the brand or model of
 * modem used.
 *
 * This should be true even if the dial-up path on one day is a land-
 * line of less than 40 ms (one way) and on the next day is a satellite
 * link of 260 to 300 ms. In the rare event that the path is one way by
 * satellite and the other way by land line with a round trip
 * measurement in the range of 90 to 260 ms, the OTM will remain a "*"
 * indicating 45 ms advance.
