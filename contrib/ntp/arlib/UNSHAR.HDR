Well, I just sent one letter off to dec.com, being from the 4.9 README I had.

So, to sum up what I said, I've included below, some code I've written to
perform async. DNS lookups - `replacements' for gethostbyname and
gethostbyaddr.  I've written and tested it mainly on a HP-UX machine, so
I'm not sure how it will port to others, but I've tried to keep the amount
of OS specific code to a minimum.

The Makefile is setup to work best from "contrib/arlib", which is how I
checked to make sure it worked and ran well.  There's a man page included
also.

Cheers,
Darren
