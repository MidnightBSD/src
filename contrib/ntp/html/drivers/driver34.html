        <h4>Synopsis</h4>
        Address: 127.127.34.<i>u</i><br>
        Reference ID: <tt>WWVB</tt><br>
        Driver ID: <tt>ULINK</tt><br>
        Serial Port: <tt>/dev/wwvb<i>u</i></tt>; 9600 bps, 8-bits, no parity<br>
        <br>
        Features: <tt>(none)</tt>
        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>This driver supports the Ultralink Model 320 RS-232 powered WWVB receiver. PDF specs available on <a href="http://www.ulio.com">www.ulio.com</a>. This driver also supports the Model 330,331,332 decoders in both polled or continous time code mode. Leap second and quality are supported.</p>
        <p>Most of this code is originally from refclock_wwvb.c with thanks. Any mistakes are mine. Any improvements are welcome.</p>

        <pre>
  The Model 320 timecode format is:
 
   &lt;cr&gt;&lt;lf&gt;SQRYYYYDDD+HH:MM:SS.mmLT&lt;cr&gt;
 
  where:
 
  S = 'S' -- sync'd in last hour, '0'-'9' - hours x 10 since last update, else '?'
  Q = Number of correlating time-frames, from 0 to 5
  R = 'R' -- reception in progress, 'N' -- Noisy reception, ' ' -- standby mode
  YYYY = year from 1990 to 2089
  DDD = current day from 1 to 366
  + = '+' if current year is a leap year, else ' '
  HH = UTC hour 0 to 23
  MM = Minutes of current hour from 0 to 59
  SS = Seconds of current minute from 0 to 59
  mm = 10's milliseconds of the current second from 00 to 99
  L  = Leap second pending at end of month -- 'I' = inset, 'D'=delete
  T  = DST &lt;-&gt; STD transition indicators
 </pre>
        <p>Note that this driver does not do anything with the T flag.</p>
        <p>The M320 also has a 'U' command which returns UT1 correction information. It is not used in this driver.</p>
        <hr>
        <pre>
  The Model 33x timecode format is:

    S9+D 00 YYYY+DDDUTCS HH:MM:SSl+5

  Where:

  S =    sync indicator S insync N not in sync
         the sync flag is WWVB decoder sync
         nothing to do with time being correct
  9+ =   signal level 0 thru 9+ If over 9 indicated as 9+
  D  =   data bit ( fun to watch but useless ;-)
  space
  00 =   hours since last GOOD WWVB frame sync
  space
  YYYY = current year
  +  =   leap year indicator
  DDD =  day of year
  UTC =  timezone (always UTC)
  S  =   daylight savings indicator
  space
  HH  =  hours
  :  =   This is the REAL in sync indicator (: = insync)
  MM  =  minutes
  :  =   : = in sync ? = NOT in sync
  SS  =  seconds
  L  =   leap second flag
  +5 =   UT1 correction (sign + digit ))
 </pre>
        <p>This driver ignores UT1 correction,DST indicator,Leap year and signal level.</p>
        <hr>
        <h4>Fudge factors</h4>
        <p>flag1 polling enable (1=poll 0=no poll)</p>
