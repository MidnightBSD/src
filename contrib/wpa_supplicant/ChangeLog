ChangeLog for wpa_supplicant

2006-02-08 - v0.4.8
	* fixed PC/SC code to use correct length for GSM AUTH command buffer
	  and to not use pioRecvPci with SCardTransmit() calls; these were not
	  causing visible problems with pcsc-lite, but Windows Winscard.dll
	  refused the previously used parameters; this fixes EAP-SIM and
	  EAP-AKA authentication using SIM/USIM card under Windows
	* added support for EAP-FAST key derivation using other ciphers than
	  RC4-128-SHA for authentication and AES128-SHA for provisioning
	* fixed EAP-SIM and EAP-AKA pseudonym and fast re-authentication to
	  decrypt AT_ENCR_DATA attributes correctly
	* added support for configuring CA certificate as DER file and as a
	  configuration blob
	* fixed private key configuration as configuration blob and added
	  support for using PKCS#12 as a blob
	* fixed cygwin build
	* added support for loading trusted CA certificates from Windows
	  certificate store: ca_cert="cert_store://<name>", where <name> is
	  likely CA (Intermediate CA certificates) or ROOT (root certificates)
	* fixed TLS library deinitialization after RSN pre-authentication not
	  to disable TLS library for normal authentication
	* fixed PMKSA cache processing not to trigger deauthentication if the
	  current PMKSA cache entry is replaced with a valid new entry
	* fixed PC/SC initialization for ap_scan != 1 modes (this fixes
	  EAP-SIM and EAP-AKA with real SIM/USIM card when using ap_scan=0 or
	  ap_scan=2)
	* do not try to use USIM APDUs when initializing PC/SC for SIM card
	  access for a network that has not enabled EAP-AKA

2005-11-20 - v0.4.7 (beginning of 0.4.x stable releases)
	* l2_packet_pcap: fixed wired IEEE 802.1X authentication with libpcap
	  and WinPcap to receive frames sent to PAE group address
	* disable EAP state machine when IEEE 802.1X authentication is not used
	  in order to get rid of bogus "EAP failed" messages
	* fixed OpenSSL error reporting to go through all pending errors to
	  avoid confusing reports of old errors being reported at later point
	  during handshake
	* fixed configuration file updating to not write empty variables
	  (e.g., proto or key_mgmt) that the file parser would not accept
	* fixed ADD_NETWORK ctrl_iface command to use the same default values
	  for variables as empty network definitions read from config file
	  would get
	* fixed EAP state machine to not discard EAP-Failure messages in many
	  cases (e.g., during TLS handshake)
	* fixed a infinite loop in private key reading if the configured file
	  cannot be parsed successfully
	* driver_madwifi: added support for madwifi-ng
	* wpa_gui: do not display password/PSK field contents
	* wpa_gui: added CA certificate configuration
	* driver_ndis: fixed scan request in ap_scan=2 mode not to change SSID
	* driver_ndis: include Beacon IEs in AssocInfo in order to notice if
	  the new AP is using different WPA/RSN IE
	* use longer timeout for IEEE 802.11 association to avoid problems with
	  drivers that may take more than five second to associate

2005-10-27 - v0.4.6
	* allow fallback to WPA, if mixed WPA+WPA2 networks have mismatch in
	  RSN IE, but WPA IE would match with wpa_supplicant configuration
	* added support for named configuration blobs in order to avoid having
	  to use file system for external files (e.g., certificates);
	  variables can be set to "blob://<blob name>" instead of file path to
	  use a named blob; supported fields: pac_file, client_cert,
	  private_key
	* fixed RSN pre-authentication (it was broken in the clean up of WPA
	  state machine interface in v0.4.5)
	* driver_madwifi: set IEEE80211_KEY_GROUP flag for group keys to make
	  sure the driver configures broadcast decryption correctly
	* added ca_path (and ca_path2) configuration variables that can be used
	  to configure OpenSSL CA path, e.g., /etc/ssl/certs, for using the
	  system-wide trusted CA list
	* added support for starting wpa_supplicant without a configuration
	  file (-C argument must be used to set ctrl_interface parameter for
	  this case; in addition, -p argument can be used to provide
	  driver_param; these new arguments can also be used with a
	  configuration to override the values from the configuration)
	* added global control interface that can be optionally used for adding
	  and removing network interfaces dynamically (-g command line argument
	  for both wpa_supplicant and wpa_cli) without having to restart
	  wpa_supplicant process
	* wpa_gui:
	  - try to save configuration whenever something is modified
	  - added WEP key configuration
	  - added possibility to edit the current network configuration
	* driver_ndis: fixed driver polling not to increase frequency on each
	  received EAPOL frame due to incorrectly cancelled timeout
	* added simple configuration file examples (in examples subdirectory)
	* fixed driver_wext.c to filter wireless events based on ifindex to
	  avoid interfaces receiving events from other interfaces
	* delay sending initial EAPOL-Start couple of seconds to speed up
	  authentication for the most common case of Authenticator starting
	  EAP authentication immediately after association

2005-09-25 - v0.4.5
	* added a workaround for clearing keys with ndiswrapper to allow
	  roaming from WPA enabled AP to plaintext one
	* added docbook documentation (doc/docbook) that can be used to
	  generate, e.g., man pages
	* l2_packet_linux: use socket type SOCK_DGRAM instead of SOCK_RAW for
	  PF_PACKET in order to prepare for network devices that do not use
	  Ethernet headers (e.g., network stack with native IEEE 802.11 frames)
	* use receipt of EAPOL-Key frame as a lower layer success indication
	  for EAP state machine to allow recovery from dropped EAP-Success
	  frame
	* cleaned up internal EAPOL frame processing by not including link
	  layer (Ethernet) header during WPA and EAPOL/EAP processing; this
	  header is added only when transmitted the frame; this makes it easier
	  to use wpa_supplicant on link layers that use different header than
	  Ethernet
	* updated EAP-PSK to use draft 9 by default since this can now be
	  tested with hostapd; removed support for draft 3, including
	  server_nai configuration option from network blocks
	* driver_wired: add PAE address to the multicast address list in order
	  to be able to receive EAPOL frames with drivers that do not include
	  these multicast addresses by default
	* driver_wext: add support for WE-19
	* added support for multiple configuration backends (CONFIG_BACKEND
	  option); currently, only 'file' is supported (i.e., the format used
	  in wpa_supplicant.conf)
	* added support for updating configuration ('wpa_cli save_config');
	  this is disabled by default and can be enabled with global
	  update_config=1 variable in wpa_supplicant.conf; this allows wpa_cli
	  and wpa_gui to store the configuration changes in a permanent store
	* added GET_NETWORK ctrl_iface command
	  (e.g., 'wpa_cli get_network 0 ssid')

2005-08-21 - v0.4.4
	* replaced OpenSSL patch for EAP-FAST support
	  (openssl-tls-extensions.patch) with a more generic and correct
	  patch (the new patch is not compatible with the previous one, so the
	  OpenSSL library will need to be patched with the new patch in order
	  to be able to build wpa_supplicant with EAP-FAST support)
	* added support for using Windows certificate store (through CryptoAPI)
	  for client certificate and private key operations (EAP-TLS)
	  (see wpa_supplicant.conf for more information on how to configure
	  this with private_key)
	* ported wpa_gui to Windows
	* added Qt4 version of wpa_gui (wpa_gui-qt4 directory); this can be
	  built with the open source version of the Qt4 for Windows
	* allow non-WPA modes (e.g., IEEE 802.1X with dynamic WEP) to be used
	  with drivers that do not support WPA
	* ndis_events: fixed Windows 2000 support
	* added support for enabling/disabling networks from the list of all
	  configured networks ('wpa_cli enable_network <network id>' and
	  'wpa_cli disable_network <network id>')
	* added support for adding and removing network from the current
	  configuration ('wpa_cli add_network' and 'wpa_cli remove_network
	  <network id>'); added networks are disabled by default and they can
	  be enabled with enable_network command once the configuration is done
	  for the new network; note: configuration file is not yet updated, so
	  these new networks are lost when wpa_supplicant is restarted
	* added support for setting network configuration parameters through
	  the control interface, for example:
	  wpa_cli set_network 0 ssid "\"my network\""
	* fixed parsing of strings that include both " and # within double
	  quoted area (e.g., "start"#end")
	* added EAP workaround for PEAP session resumption: allow outer,
	  i.e., not tunneled, EAP-Success to terminate session since; this can
	  be disabled with eap_workaround=0
	  (this was allowed for PEAPv1 before, but now it is also allowed for
	  PEAPv0 since at least one RADIUS authentication server seems to be
	  doing this for PEAPv0, too)
	* wpa_gui: added preliminary support for adding new networks to the
	  wpa_supplicant configuration (double click on the scan results to
	  open network configuration)

2005-06-26 - v0.4.3
	* removed interface for external EAPOL/EAP supplicant (e.g.,
	  Xsupplicant), (CONFIG_XSUPPLICANT_IFACE) since it is not required
	  anymore and is unlikely to be used by anyone
	* driver_ndis: fixed WinPcap 3.0 support
	* fixed build with CONFIG_DNET_PCAP=y on Linux
	* l2_packet: moved different implementations into separate files
	  (l2_packet_*.c)

2005-06-12 - v0.4.2
	* driver_ipw: updated driver structures to match with ipw2200-1.0.4
	  (note: ipw2100-1.1.0 is likely to require an update to work with
	  this)
	* added support for using ap_scan=2 mode with multiple network blocks;
	  wpa_supplicant will go through the networks one by one until the
	  driver reports a successful association; this uses the same order for
	  networks as scan_ssid=1 scans, i.e., the priority field is ignored
	  and the network block order in the file is used instead
	* fixed a potential issue in RSN pre-authentication ending up using
	  freed memory if pre-authentication times out
	* added support for matching alternative subject name extensions of the
	  authentication server certificate; new configuration variables
	  altsubject_match and altsubject_match2
	* driver_ndis: added support for IEEE 802.1X authentication with wired
	  NDIS drivers
	* added support for querying private key password (EAP-TLS) through the
	  control interface (wpa_cli/wpa_gui) if one is not included in the
	  configuration file
	* driver_broadcom: fixed couple of memory leaks in scan result
	  processing
	* EAP-PAX is now registered as EAP type 46
	* fixed EAP-PAX MAC calculation
	* fixed EAP-PAX CK and ICK key derivation
	* added support for using password with EAP-PAX (as an alternative to
	  entering key with eappsk); SHA-1 hash of the password will be used as
	  the key in this case
	* added support for arbitrary driver interface parameters through the
	  configuration file with a new driver_param field; this adds a new
	  driver_ops function set_param()
	* added possibility to override l2_packet module with driver interface
	  API (new send_eapol handler); this can be used to implement driver
	  specific TX/RX functions for EAPOL frames
	* fixed ctrl_interface_group processing for the case where gid is
	  entered as a number, not group name
	* driver_test: added support for testing hostapd with wpa_supplicant
	  by using test driver interface without any kernel drivers or network
	  cards

2005-05-22 - v0.4.1
	* driver_madwifi: fixed WPA/WPA2 mode configuration to allow EAPOL
	  packets to be encrypted; this was apparently broken by the changed
	  ioctl order in v0.4.0
	* driver_madwifi: added preliminary support for compiling against 'BSD'
	  branch of madwifi CVS tree
	* added support for EAP-MSCHAPv2 password retries within the same EAP
	  authentication session
	* added support for password changes with EAP-MSCHAPv2 (used when the
	  password has expired)
	* added support for reading additional certificates from PKCS#12 files
	  and adding them to the certificate chain
	* fixed association with IEEE 802.1X (no WPA) when dynamic WEP keys
	  were used
	* fixed a possible double free in EAP-TTLS fast-reauthentication when
	  identity or password is entered through control interface
	* display EAP Notification messages to user through control interface
	  with "CTRL-EVENT-EAP-NOTIFICATION" prefix
	* added GUI version of wpa_cli, wpa_gui; this is not build
	  automatically with 'make'; use 'make wpa_gui' to build (this requires
	  Qt development tools)
	* added 'disconnect' command to control interface for setting
	  wpa_supplicant in state where it will not associate before
	  'reassociate' command has been used
	* added support for selecting a network from the list of all configured
	  networks ('wpa_cli select_network <network id>'; this disabled all
	  other networks; to re-enable, 'wpa_cli select_network any')
	* added support for getting scan results through control interface
	* added EAP workaround for PEAPv1 session resumption: allow outer,
	  i.e., not tunneled, EAP-Success to terminate session since; this can
	  be disabled with eap_workaround=0

2005-04-25 - v0.4.0 (beginning of 0.4.x development releases)
	* added a new build time option, CONFIG_NO_STDOUT_DEBUG, that can be
	  used to reduce the size of the wpa_supplicant considerably if
	  debugging code is not needed
	* fixed EAPOL-Key validation to drop packets with invalid Key Data
	  Length; such frames could have crashed wpa_supplicant due to buffer
	  overflow
	* added support for wired authentication (IEEE 802.1X on wired
	  Ethernet); driver interface 'wired'
	* obsoleted set_wpa() handler in the driver interface API (it can be
	  replaced by moving enable/disable functionality into init()/deinit())
	  (calls to set_wpa() are still present for backwards compatibility,
	  but they may be removed in the future)
	* driver_madwifi: fixed association in plaintext mode
	* modified the EAP workaround that accepts EAP-Success with incorrect
	  Identifier to be even less strict about verification in order to
	  interoperate with some authentication servers
	* added support for sending TLS alerts
	* added support for 'any' SSID wildcard; if ssid is not configured or
	  is set to an empty string, any SSID will be accepted for non-WPA AP
	* added support for asking PIN (for SIM) from frontends (e.g.,
	  wpa_cli); if a PIN is needed, but not included in the configuration
	  file, a control interface request is sent and EAP processing is
	  delayed until the PIN is available
	* added support for using external devices (e.g., a smartcard) for
	  private key operations in EAP-TLS (CONFIG_SMARTCARD=y in .config);
	  new wpa_supplicant.conf variables:
	  - global: opensc_engine_path, pkcs11_engine_path, pkcs11_module_path
	  - network: engine, engine_id, key_id
	* added experimental support for EAP-PAX
	* added monitor mode for wpa_cli (-a<path to a program to run>) that
	  allows external commands (e.g., shell scripts) to be run based on
	  wpa_supplicant events, e.g., when authentication has been completed
	  and data connection is ready; other related wpa_cli arguments:
	  -B (run in background), -P (write PID file); wpa_supplicant has a new
	  command line argument (-W) that can be used to make it wait until a
	  control interface command is received in order to avoid missing
	  events
	* added support for opportunistic WPA2 PMKSA key caching (disabled by
	  default, can be enabled with proactive_key_caching=1)
	* fixed RSN IE in 4-Way Handshake message 2/4 for the case where
	  Authenticator rejects PMKSA caching attempt and the driver is not
	  using assoc_info events
	* added -P<pid file> argument for wpa_supplicant to write the current
	  process id into a file

2005-02-12 - v0.3.7 (beginning of 0.3.x stable releases)
	* added new phase1 option parameter, include_tls_length=1, to force
	  wpa_supplicant to add TLS Message Length field to all TLS messages
	  even if the packet is not fragmented; this may be needed with some
	  authentication servers
	* fixed WPA/RSN IE verification in message 3 of 4-Way Handshake when
	  using drivers that take care of AP selection (e.g., when using
	  ap_scan=2)
	* fixed reprocessing of pending request after ctrl_iface requests for
	  identity/password/otp
	* fixed ctrl_iface requests for identity/password/otp in Phase 2 of
	  EAP-PEAP and EAP-TTLS
	* all drivers using driver_wext: set interface up and select Managed
	  mode when starting wpa_supplicant; set interface down when exiting
	* renamed driver_ipw2100.c to driver_ipw.c since it now supports both
	  ipw2100 and ipw2200; please note that this also changed the
	  configuration variable in .config to CONFIG_DRIVER_IPW

2005-01-24 - v0.3.6
	* fixed a busy loop introduced in v0.3.5 for scan result processing
	  when no matching AP is found

2005-01-23 - v0.3.5
	* added a workaround for an interoperability issue with a Cisco AP
	  when using WPA2-PSK
	* fixed non-WPA IEEE 802.1X to use the same authentication timeout as
	  WPA with IEEE 802.1X (i.e., timeout 10 -> 70 sec to allow
	  retransmission of dropped frames)
	* fixed issues with 64-bit CPUs and SHA1 cleanup in previous version
	  (e.g., segfault when processing EAPOL-Key frames)
	* fixed EAP workaround and fast reauthentication configuration for
	  RSN pre-authentication; previously these were disabled and
	  pre-authentication would fail if the used authentication server
	  requires EAP workarounds
	* added support for blacklisting APs that fail or timeout
	  authentication in ap_scan=1 mode so that all APs are tried in cases
	  where the ones with strongest signal level are failing authentication
	* fixed CA certificate loading after a failed EAP-TLS/PEAP/TTLS
	  authentication attempt
	* allow EAP-PEAP/TTLS fast reauthentication only if Phase 2 succeeded
	  in the previous authentication (previously, only Phase 1 success was
	  verified)

2005-01-09 - v0.3.4
	* added preliminary support for IBSS (ad-hoc) mode configuration
	  (mode=1 in network block); this included a new key_mgmt mode
	  WPA-NONE, i.e., TKIP or CCMP with a fixed key (based on psk) and no
	  key management; see wpa_supplicant.conf for more details and an
	  example on how to configure this (note: this is currently implemented
	  only for driver_hostapd.c, but the changes should be trivial to add
	  in associate() handler for other drivers, too (assuming the driver
	  supports WPA-None)
	* added preliminary port for native Windows (i.e., no cygwin) using
	  mingw

2005-01-02 - v0.3.3
	* added optional support for GNU Readline and History Libraries for
	  wpa_cli (CONFIG_READLINE)
	* cleaned up EAP state machine <-> method interface and number of
	  small problems with error case processing not terminating on
	  EAP-Failure but waiting for timeout
	* added couple of workarounds for interoperability issues with a
	  Cisco AP when using WPA2
	* added support for EAP-FAST (draft-cam-winget-eap-fast-00.txt);
	  Note: This requires a patch for openssl to add support for TLS
	  extensions and number of workarounds for operations without
	  certificates. Proof of concept type of experimental patch is
	  included in openssl-tls-extensions.patch.

2004-12-19 - v0.3.2
	* fixed private key loading for cases where passphrase is not set
	* fixed Windows/cygwin L2 packet handler freeing; previous version
	  could cause a segfault when RSN pre-authentication was completed
	* added support for PMKSA caching with drivers that generate RSN IEs
	  (e.g., NDIS); currently, this is only implemented in driver_ndis.c,
	  but similar code can be easily added to driver_ndiswrapper.c once
	  ndiswrapper gets full support for RSN PMKSA caching
	* improved recovery from PMKID mismatches by requesting full EAP
	  authentication in case of failed PMKSA caching attempt
	* driver_ndis: added support for NDIS NdisMIncidateStatus() events
	  (this requires that ndis_events is ran while wpa_supplicant is
	  running)
	* driver_ndis: use ADD_WEP/REMOVE_WEP when configuring WEP keys
	* added support for driver interfaces to replace the interface name
	  based on driver/OS specific mapping, e.g., in case of driver_ndis,
	  this allows the beginning of the adapter description to be used as
	  the interface name
	* added support for CR+LF (Windows-style) line ends in configuration
	  file
	* driver_ndis: enable radio before starting scanning, disable radio
	  when exiting
	* modified association event handler to set portEnabled = FALSE before
	  clearing port Valid in order to reset EAP state machine and avoid
	  problems with new authentication getting ignored because of state
	  machines ending up in AUTHENTICATED/SUCCESS state based on old
	  information
	* added support for driver events to add PMKID candidates in order to
	  allow drivers to give priority to most likely roaming candidates
	* driver_hostap: moved PrivacyInvoked configuration to associate()
	  function so that this will not be set for plaintext connections
	* added KEY_MGMT_802_1X_NO_WPA as a new key_mgmt type so that driver
	  interface can distinguish plaintext and IEEE 802.1X (no WPA)
	  authentication
	* fixed static WEP key configuration to use broadcast/default type for
	  all keys (previously, the default TX key was configured as pairwise/
	  unicast key)
	* driver_ndis: added legacy WPA capability detection for non-WPA2
	  drivers
	* added support for setting static WEP keys for IEEE 802.1X without
	  dynamic WEP keying (eapol_flags=0)

2004-12-12 - v0.3.1
	* added support for reading PKCS#12 (PFX) files (as a replacement for
	  PEM/DER) to get certificate and private key (CONFIG_PKCS12)
	* fixed compilation with CONFIG_PCSC=y
	* added new ap_scan mode, ap_scan=2, for drivers that take care of
	  association, but need to be configured with security policy and SSID,
	  e.g., ndiswrapper and NDIS driver; this mode should allow such
	  drivers to work with hidden SSIDs and optimized roaming; when
	  ap_scan=2 is used, only the first network block in the configuration
	  file is used and this configuration should have explicit security
	  policy (i.e., only one option in the lists) for key_mgmt, pairwise,
	  group, proto variables
	* added experimental port of wpa_supplicant for Windows
	  - driver_ndis.c driver interface (NDIS OIDs)
	  - currently, this requires cygwin and WinPcap
	  - small utility, win_if_list, can be used to get interface name
	* control interface can now be removed at build time; add
	  CONFIG_CTRL_IFACE=y to .config to maintain old functionality
	* optional Xsupplicant interface can now be removed at build time;
	  (CONFIG_XSUPPLICANT_IFACE=y in .config to bring it back)
	* added auth_alg to driver interface associate() parameters to make it
	  easier for drivers to configure authentication algorithm as part of
	  the association

2004-12-05 - v0.3.0 (beginning of 0.3.x development releases)
	* driver_broadcom: added new driver interface for Broadcom wl.o driver
	  (a generic driver for Broadcom IEEE 802.11a/g cards)
	* wpa_cli: fixed parsing of -p <path> command line argument
	* PEAPv1: fixed tunneled EAP-Success reply handling to reply with TLS
	  ACK, not tunneled EAP-Success (of which only the first byte was
	  actually send due to a bug in previous code); this seems to
	  interoperate with most RADIUS servers that implements PEAPv1
	* PEAPv1: added support for terminating PEAP authentication on tunneled
	  EAP-Success message; this can be configured by adding
	  peap_outer_success=0 on phase1 parameters in wpa_supplicant.conf
	  (some RADIUS servers require this whereas others require a tunneled
	  reply
	* PEAPv1: changed phase1 option peaplabel to use default to 0, i.e., to
	  the old label for key derivation; previously, the default was 1,
	  but it looks like most existing PEAPv1 implementations use the old
	  label which is thus more suitable default option
	* added support for EAP-PSK (draft-bersani-eap-psk-03.txt)
	* fixed parsing of wep_tx_keyidx
	* added support for configuring list of allowed Phase 2 EAP types
	  (for both EAP-PEAP and EAP-TTLS) instead of only one type
	* added support for configuring IEEE 802.11 authentication algorithm
	  (auth_alg; mainly for using Shared Key authentication with static
	  WEP keys)
	* added support for EAP-AKA (with UMTS SIM)
	* fixed couple of errors in PCSC handling that could have caused
	  random-looking errors for EAP-SIM
	* added support for EAP-SIM pseudonyms and fast re-authentication
	* added support for EAP-TLS/PEAP/TTLS fast re-authentication (TLS
	  session resumption)
	* added support for EAP-SIM with two challanges
	  (phase1="sim_min_num_chal=3" can be used to require three challenges)
	* added support for configuring DH/DSA parameters for an ephemeral DH
	  key exchange (EAP-TLS/PEAP/TTLS) using new configuration parameters
	  dh_file and dh_file2 (phase 2); this adds support for using DSA keys
	  and optional DH key exchange to achieve forward secracy with RSA keys
	* added support for matching subject of the authentication server
	  certificate with a substring when using EAP-TLS/PEAP/TTLS; new
	  configuration variables subject_match and subject_match2
	* changed SSID configuration in driver_wext.c (used by many driver
	  interfaces) to use ssid_len+1 as the length for SSID since some Linux
	  drivers expect this
	* fixed couple of unaligned reads in scan result parsing to fix WPA
	  connection on some platforms (e.g., ARM)
	* added driver interface for Intel ipw2100 driver
	* added support for LEAP with WPA
	* added support for larger scan results report (old limit was 4 kB of
	  data, i.e., about 35 or so APs) when using Linux wireless extensions
	  v17 or newer
	* fixed a bug in PMKSA cache processing: skip sending of EAPOL-Start
	  only if there is a PMKSA cache entry for the current AP
	* fixed error handling for case where reading of scan results fails:
	  must schedule a new scan or wpa_supplicant will remain waiting
	  forever
	* changed debug output to remove shared password/key material by
	  default; all key information can be included with -K command line
	  argument to match the previous behavior
	* added support for timestamping debug log messages (disabled by
	  default, can be enabled with -t command line argument)
	* set pairwise/group cipher suite for non-WPA IEEE 802.1X to WEP-104
	  if keys are not configured to be used; this fixes IEEE 802.1X mode
	  with drivers that use this information to configure whether Privacy
	  bit can be in Beacon frames (e.g., ndiswrapper)
	* avoid clearing driver keys if no keys have been configured since last
	  key clear request; this seems to improve reliability of group key
	  handshake for ndiswrapper & NDIS driver which seems to be suffering
	  of some kind of timing issue when the keys are cleared again after
	  association
	* changed driver interface API:
	  - WPA_SUPPLICANT_DRIVER_VERSION define can be used to determine which
	    version is being used (now, this is set to 2; previously, it was
	    not defined)
	  - pass pointer to private data structure to all calls
	  - the new API is not backwards compatible; all in-tree driver
	    interfaces has been converted to the new API
	* added support for controlling multiple interfaces (radios) per
	  wpa_supplicant process; each interface needs to be listed on the
	  command line (-c, -i, -D arguments) with -N as a separator
	  (-cwpa1.conf -iwlan0 -Dhostap -N -cwpa2.conf -iath0 -Dmadwifi)
	* added a workaround for EAP servers that incorrectly use same Id for
	  sequential EAP packets
	* changed libpcap/libdnet configuration to use .config variable,
	  CONFIG_DNET_PCAP, instead of requiring Makefile modification
	* improved downgrade attack detection in IE verification of msg 3/4:
	  verify both WPA and RSN IEs, if present, not only the selected one;
	  reject the AP if an RSN IE is found in msg 3/4, but not in Beacon or
	  Probe Response frame, and RSN is enabled in wpa_supplicant
	  configuration
	* fixed WPA msg 3/4 processing to allow Key Data field contain other
	  IEs than just one WPA IE
	* added support for FreeBSD and driver interface for the BSD net80211
	  layer (CONFIG_DRIVER_BSD=y in .config); please note that some of the
	  required kernel mods have not yet been committed
	* made EAP workarounds configurable; enabled by default, can be
	  disabled with network block option eap_workaround=0

2004-07-17 - v0.2.4 (beginning of 0.2.x stable releases)
	* resolved couple of interoperability issues with EAP-PEAPv1 and
	  Phase 2 (inner EAP) fragment reassembly
	* driver_madwifi: fixed WEP key configuration for IEEE 802.1X when the
	  AP is using non-zero key index for the unicast key and key index zero
	  for the broadcast key
	* driver_hostap: fixed IEEE 802.1X WEP key updates and
	  re-authentication by allowing unencrypted EAPOL frames when not using
	  WPA
	* added a new driver interface, 'wext', which uses only standard,
	  driver independent functionality in Linux wireless extensions;
	  currently, this can be used only for non-WPA IEEE 802.1X mode, but
	  eventually, this is to be extended to support full WPA/WPA2 once
	  Linux wireless extensions get support for this
	* added support for mode in which the driver is responsible for AP
	  scanning and selection; this is disabled by default and can be
	  enabled with global ap_scan=0 variable in wpa_supplicant.conf;
	  this mode can be used, e.g., with generic 'wext' driver interface to
	  use wpa_supplicant as IEEE 802.1X Supplicant with any Linux driver
	  supporting wireless extensions.
	* driver_madwifi: fixed WPA2 configuration and scan_ssid=1 (e.g.,
	  operation with an AP that does not include SSID in the Beacon frames)
	* added support for new EAP authentication methods:
	  EAP-TTLS/EAP-OTP, EAP-PEAPv0/OTP, EAP-PEAPv1/OTP, EAP-OTP
	* added support for asking one-time-passwords from frontends (e.g.,
	  wpa_cli); this 'otp' command works otherwise like 'password' command,
	  but the password is used only once and the frontend will be asked for
	  a new password whenever a request from authenticator requires a
	  password; this can be used with both EAP-OTP and EAP-GTC
	* changed wpa_cli to automatically re-establish connection so that it
	  does not need to be re-started when wpa_supplicant is terminated and
	  started again
	* improved user data (identity/password/otp) requests through
	  frontends: process pending EAPOL packets after getting new
	  information so that full authentication does not need to be
	  restarted; in addition, send pending requests again whenever a new
	  frontend is attached
	* changed control frontends to use a new directory for socket files to
	  make it easier for wpa_cli to automatically select between interfaces
	  and to provide access control for the control interface;
	  wpa_supplicant.conf: ctrl_interface is now a path
	  (/var/run/wpa_supplicant is the recommended path) and
	  ctrl_interface_group can be used to select which group gets access to
	  the control interface;
	  wpa_cli: by default, try to connect to the first interface available
	  in /var/run/wpa_supplicant; this path can be overriden with -p option
	  and an interface can be selected with -i option (i.e., in most common
	  cases, wpa_cli does not need to get any arguments)
	* added support for LEAP
	* added driver interface for Linux ndiswrapper
	* added priority option for network blocks in the configuration file;
	  this allows networks to be grouped based on priority (the scan
	  results are searched for matches with network blocks in this order)

2004-06-20 - v0.2.3
	* sort scan results to improve AP selection
	* fixed control interface socket removal for some error cases
	* improved scan requesting and authentication timeout
	* small improvements/bug fixes for EAP-MSCHAPv2, EAP-PEAP, and
	  TLS processing
	* PEAP version can now be forced with phase1="peapver=<ver>"
	  (mostly for testing; by default, the highest version supported by
	  both the Supplicant and Authentication Server is selected
	  automatically)
	* added support for madwifi driver (Atheros ar521x)
	* added a workaround for cases where AP sets Install Tx/Rx bit for
	  WPA Group Key messages when pairwise keys are used (without this,
	  the Group Key would be used for Tx and the AP would drop frames
	  from the station)
	* added GSM SIM/USIM interface for GSM authentication algorithm for
	  EAP-SIM; this requires pcsc-lite
	* added support for ATMEL AT76C5XXx driver
	* fixed IEEE 802.1X WEP key derivation in the case where Authenticator
	  does not include key data in the EAPOL-Key frame (i.e., part of
	  EAP keying material is used as data encryption key)
	* added support for using plaintext and static WEP networks
	  (key_mgmt=NONE)

2004-05-31 - v0.2.2
	* added support for new EAP authentication methods:
	  EAP-TTLS/EAP-MD5-Challenge
	  EAP-TTLS/EAP-GTC
	  EAP-TTLS/EAP-MSCHAPv2
	  EAP-TTLS/EAP-TLS
	  EAP-TTLS/MSCHAPv2
	  EAP-TTLS/MSCHAP
	  EAP-TTLS/PAP
	  EAP-TTLS/CHAP
	  EAP-PEAP/TLS
	  EAP-PEAP/GTC
	  EAP-PEAP/MD5-Challenge
	  EAP-GTC
	  EAP-SIM (not yet complete; needs GSM/SIM authentication interface)
	* added support for anonymous identity (to be used when identity is
	  sent in plaintext; real identity will be used within TLS protected
	  tunnel (e.g., with EAP-TTLS)
	* added event messages from wpa_supplicant to frontends, e.g., wpa_cli
	* added support for requesting identity and password information using
	  control interface; in other words, the password for EAP-PEAP or
	  EAP-TTLS does not need to be included in the configuration file since
	  a frontand (e.g., wpa_cli) can ask it from the user
	* improved RSN pre-authentication to use a candidate list and process
	  all candidates from each scan; not only one per scan
	* fixed RSN IE and WPA IE capabilities field parsing
	* ignore Tx bit in GTK IE when Pairwise keys are used
	* avoid making new scan requests during IEEE 802.1X negotiation
	* use openssl/libcrypto for MD5 and SHA-1 when compiling wpa_supplicant
	  with TLS support (this replaces the included implementation with
	  library code to save about 8 kB since the library code is needed
	  anyway for TLS)
	* fixed WPA-PSK only mode when compiled without IEEE 802.1X support
	  (i.e., without CONFIG_IEEE8021X_EAPOL=y in .config)

2004-05-06 - v0.2.1
	* added support for internal IEEE 802.1X (actually, IEEE 802.1aa/D6.1)
	  Supplicant
	  - EAPOL state machines for Supplicant [IEEE 802.1aa/D6.1]
	  - EAP peer state machine [draft-ietf-eap-statemachine-02.pdf]
	  - EAP-MD5 (cannot be used with WPA-RADIUS)
	    [draft-ietf-eap-rfc2284bis-09.txt]
	  - EAP-TLS [RFC 2716]
	  - EAP-MSCHAPv2 (currently used only with EAP-PEAP)
	  - EAP-PEAP/MSCHAPv2 [draft-josefsson-pppext-eap-tls-eap-07.txt]
	    [draft-kamath-pppext-eap-mschapv2-00.txt]
	    (PEAP version 0, 1, and parts of 2; only 0 and 1 are enabled by
	    default; tested with FreeRADIUS, Microsoft IAS, and Funk Odyssey)
	  - new configuration file options: eap, identity, password, ca_cert,
	    client_cert, privatekey, private_key_passwd
	  - Xsupplicant is not required anymore, but it can be used by
	    disabling the internal IEEE 802.1X Supplicant with -e command line
	    option
	  - this code is not included in the default build; Makefile need to
	    be edited for this (uncomment lines for selected functionality)
	  - EAP-TLS and EAP-PEAP require openssl libraries
	* use module prefix in debug messages (WPA, EAP, EAP-TLS, ..)
	* added support for non-WPA IEEE 802.1X mode with dynamic WEP keys
	  (i.e., complete IEEE 802.1X/EAP authentication and use IEEE 802.1X
	   EAPOL-Key frames instead of WPA key handshakes)
	* added support for IEEE 802.11i/RSN (WPA2)
	  - improved PTK Key Handshake
	  - PMKSA caching, pre-authentication
	* fixed wpa_supplicant to ignore possible extra data after WPA
	  EAPOL-Key packets (this fixes 'Invalid EAPOL-Key MIC when using
	  TPTK' error from message 3 of 4-Way Handshake in case the AP
	  includes extra data after the EAPOL-Key)
	* added interface for external programs (frontends) to control
	  wpa_supplicant
	  - CLI example (wpa_cli) with interactive mode and command line
	    mode
	  - replaced SIGUSR1 status/statistics with the new control interface
	* made some feature compile time configurable
	  - .config file for make
	  - driver interfaces (hostap, hermes, ..)
	  - EAPOL/EAP functions

2004-02-15 - v0.2.0
	* Initial version of wpa_supplicant
