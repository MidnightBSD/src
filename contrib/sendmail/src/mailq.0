[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mMailq [22mprints a summary of the mail messages queued for future delivery.

       The first line printed for each message shows the  internal  identifier
       used on this host for the message with a possible status character, the
       size of the message in  bytes,  the  date  and  time  the  message  was
       accepted  into  the queue, and the envelope sender of the message.  The
       second line shows the error message that  caused  this  message  to  be
       retained  in  the queue; it will not be present if the message is being
       processed for the first time.  The status characters are  either  [1m*  [22mto
       indicate the job is being processed; [1mX [22mto indicate that the load is too
       high to process the job; and [1m- [22mto indicate that the job is too young to
       process.  The following lines show message recipients, one per line.

       [1mMailq [22mis identical to ``sendmail -bp''.

       The relevant options are as follows:

       [1m-Ac    [22mShow  the mail submission queue specified in [4m/etc/mail/submit.cf[0m
              instead of the MTA queue specified in [4m/etc/mail/sendmail.cf[24m.

       [1m-qL    [22mShow the "lost" items in the mail queue instead  of  the  normal
              queue items.

       [1m-qQ    [22mShow the quarantined items in the mail queue instead of the nor-
              mal queue items.

       [1m-q[22m[[4m![24m]I substr
              Limit processed jobs to those containing [4msubstr[24m as  a  substring
              of the queue id or not when [4m![24m  is specified.

       [1m-q[22m[[4m![24m]Q substr
              Limit  processed jobs to quarantined jobs containing [4msubstr[24m as a
              substring of the quarantine reason or not when [4m![24m  is  specified.

       [1m-q[22m[[4m![24m]R substr
              Limit  processed  jobs to those containing [4msubstr[24m as a substring
              of one of the recipients or not when [4m![24m  is specified.

       [1m-q[22m[[4m![24m]S substr
              Limit processed jobs to those containing [4msubstr[24m as  a  substring
              of the sender or not when [4m![24m  is specified.

       [1m-v     [22mPrint  verbose  information.  This adds the priority of the mes-
              sage and a single character indicator (``+'' or blank)  indicat-
              ing whether a warning message has been sent on the first line of
              the message.  Additionally, extra lines may be  intermixed  with
              the  recipients indicating the ``controlling user'' information;
              this shows who will own any programs that are executed on behalf
              of  this message and the name of the alias this command expanded
              from, if any.  Moreover, status messages for each recipient  are
              printed if available.

       Several  sendmail.cf  options influence the behavior of the [1mmailq [22mutil-
       ity: The number of items printed  per  queue  group  is  restricted  by
       [1mMaxQueueRunSize  [22mif  that  value is set.  The status character [1m* [22mis not
       printed for some values of [1mQueueSortOrder, [22me.g., filename, random, mod-
       ification,  and none, unless a [1m-q [22moption is used to limit the processed
       jobs.

       The [1mmailq [22mutility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
