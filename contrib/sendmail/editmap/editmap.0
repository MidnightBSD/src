       [1meditmap [22m- query and edit single records in database maps for sendmail

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mEditmap [22mqueries or edits one record in database maps used by the  keyed
       map  lookups  in sendmail(8).  Arguments are passed on the command line
       and output (for queries) is directed to standard output.

       Depending on how it is compiled, [1meditmap [22mhandles up to three  different
       database formats, selected using the [4mmaptype[24m parameter.  They may be

       dbm    DBM format maps.  This requires the ndbm(3) library.

       btree  B-Tree  format maps.  This requires the new Berkeley DB library.

       hash   Hash format maps.  This also requires the Berkeley DB library.

       If the [4mTrustedUser[24m option is set in the sendmail configuration file and
       [1meditmap  [22mis  invoked  as root, the generated files will be owned by the
       specified [4mTrustedUser.[0m

   [1mFlags[0m
       [1m-C     [22mUse the specified [1msendmail [22mconfiguration file for looking up the
              TrustedUser option.

       [1m-N     [22mInclude  the  null  byte that terminates strings in the map (for
              alias maps).

       [1m-f     [22mNormally all upper case letters in the key are folded  to  lower
              case.   This  flag disables that behaviour.  This is intended to
              mesh with the -f flag in the [1mK [22mline in sendmail.cf.   The  value
              is never case folded.

       [1m-q     [22mQuery  the  map for the specified key.  If found, print value to
              standard output and exit with 0.  If not  found  then  print  an
              error message to stdout and exit with EX_UNAVAILABLE.

       [1m-u     [22mUpdate  the record for [4mkey[24m with [4mvalue[24m or inserts a new record if
              one doesn't exist.  Exits with 0 on success or EX_IOERR on fail-
              ure.

       [1m-x     [22mDeletes  the specific key from the map.  Exits with 0 on success
              or EX_IOERR on failure.
