       MMaakkeemmaapp creates the database maps used by  the  keyed  map  lookups  in
       sendmail(8).   It  reads input from the standard input and outputs them
       to the indicated _m_a_p_n_a_m_e_.

       Depending on how it is compiled, mmaakkeemmaapp handles up to three  different
       database formats, selected using the _m_a_p_t_y_p_e parameter.  They may be

       dbm    DBM format maps.  This requires the ndbm(3) library.

       btree  B-Tree  format maps.  This requires the new Berkeley DB library.

       hash   Hash format maps.  This also requires the Berkeley DB library.

       In all cases, mmaakkeemmaapp reads lines from the standard input consisting of
       two words separated by white space.  The first is the database key, the
       second is the value.  The value may contain ``%_n'' strings to  indicate
       parameter  substitution.   Literal percents should be doubled (``%%'').
       Blank lines and lines beginning with ``#'' are ignored.

       Notice: do nnoott use  mmaakkeemmaapp  to  create  the  aliases  data  base,  but
       nneewwaalliiaasseess  which  puts  a  special  token  into  the data base that is
       required by sseennddmmaaiill..

       If the _T_r_u_s_t_e_d_U_s_e_r option is set in the sendmail configuration file and
       mmaakkeemmaapp  is  invoked  as root, the generated files will be owned by the
       specified _T_r_u_s_t_e_d_U_s_e_r_.

   FFllaaggss
       --CC     Use the specified sseennddmmaaiill configuration file for looking up the
              TrustedUser option.

       --NN     Include  the null byte that terminates strings in the map.  This
              must match the -N flag in the sendmail.cf ``K'' line.

       --cc     Use the specified hash and B-Tree cache size.

       --DD     Use to specify the character to use to indicate a comment (which
              is ignored) instead of the default of '#'.

       --dd     Allow duplicate keys in the map.  This is only allowed on B-Tree
              format maps.  If two identical keys are read, they will both  be
              inserted into the map.

       --ee     Allow empty value (right hand side).

       --ff     Normally  all  upper case letters in the key are folded to lower
              case.  This flag disables that behaviour.  This is  intended  to
              mesh  with  the -f flag in the KK line in sendmail.cf.  The value
              is never case folded.

       --ll     List supported map types.

       --oo     Append to an old file.  This allows you to augment  an  existing
              file.

       --rr     Allow  replacement of existing keys.  Normally mmaakkeemmaapp complains
              if you repeat a key, and does not do the insert.

       --ss     Ignore safety checks  on  maps  being  created.   This  includes
              checking  for  hard or symbolic links in world writable directo-
              ries.

       --tt     Use the specified delimiter instead of  white  space  (also  for
              dumping a map).

       --uu     dump (unmap) the content of the database to standard output.

       --vv     Verbosely print what it is doing.
