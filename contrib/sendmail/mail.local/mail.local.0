       MMaaiill..llooccaall reads the standard input up to an end-of-file and appends it
       to each _u_s_e_r_'_s mmaaiill file.  The _u_s_e_r must be a valid user name.

       The options are as follows:

       --77        Do not advertise 8BITMIME support in LMTP mode.

       --bb        Return  a  permanent  error instead of a temporary error if a
                 mailbox exceeds quota.

       --dd        Specify this is  a  delivery  (for  backward  compatibility).
                 This option has no effect.

       --DD _m_b_d_b   Specify  the  name  of  the mailbox database which is used to
                 look up local recipient names.  This option defaults to "pw",
                 which means use getpwnam().

       --ff _f_r_o_m   Specify the sender's name.

       --ll        Turn on LMTP mode.

       --rr _f_r_o_m   Specify the sender's name (for backward compatibility).  Same
                 as -f.

       --hh _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
                 Store incoming mail in _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e in the user's home  directory
                 instead of a system mail spool directory.

       The  next  options  are  only available if mmaaiill..llooccaall has been compiled
       with -DHASHSPOOL.

       --HH _h_a_s_h_t_y_p_e_h_a_s_h_d_e_p_t_h
              Select hashed mail directories.  Valid hash types are uu for user
              name  and  mm for MD5 (requires compilation with -DHASHSPOOLMD5).
              Example: --HH _u_2 selects user name hashing with a hash depth of 2.
              Note:  there  must  be  no  space  between the hash type and the
              depth.

       --pp _p_a_t_h
              Specify an alternate mail spool path.

       --nn     Specify that the domain part of recipient addresses in LMTP mode
              should not be stripped.

       Individual  mail messages in the mailbox are delimited by an empty line
       followed by a line beginning with the string ``From ''.   A  line  con-
       taining  the  string  ``From  '', the sender's name and a time stamp is
       prepended to each delivered mail message.  A blank line is appended  to
       each  message.   A  greater-than  character (``>'') is prepended to any
       line in the message which could be mistaken for a ``From  ''  delimiter
       line (that is, a line beginning with the five characters ``From '' fol-
       lowing a blank line).

       The mail files are exclusively  locked  with  flock(2)  while  mail  is
       appended,  and  a  uusseerr..lloocckk  file also is created while the mailbox is
       locked for compatibility with older MUAs.

       If the ``biff'' service  is  returned  by  getservbyname(3),  the  biff
       server is notified of delivered mail.

       The mmaaiill..llooccaall utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
       TZ     Used to set the appropriate time zone on the timestamp.

FFIILLEESS
       /tmp/local.XXXXXX     temporary files
       /var/mail/user        user's default mailbox directory
       /var/mail/user.lock   lock file for a user's default mailbox

SSEEEE AALLSSOO
       mail(1), xsend(1), flock(2), getservbyname(3), comsat(8), sendmail(8)

WWAARRNNIINNGG
       mmaaiill..llooccaall  escapes  only "^From " lines that follow an empty line.  If
       all lines starting with "From " should be escaped, use the 'E' flag for
       the local mailer in the sendmail.cf file.

HHIISSTTOORRYY
       A  superset  of  mmaaiill..llooccaall  (handling  mailbox reading as well as mail
       delivery) appeared in Version 7 AT&T UNIX as the program mmaaiill.
