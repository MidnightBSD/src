<h2>Introduction</h2>

<P>
Sendmail's Content Management API (milter) provides third-party
programs to access mail messages as they are being processed by the
Mail Transfer Agent (MTA), allowing them to examine and modify message
content and meta-information.  Filtering policies implemented by
Milter-conformant filters may then be centrally configured and
composed in an end-user's MTA configuration file.

<p>
Possible uses for filters include spam rejection, virus
filtering, and content control.  In general, Milter seeks to address
site-wide filtering concerns in a scalable way.  Individual users' mail
filtering needs (e.g. sorting messages by subject) are left to
client-level programs such as <a href="http://www.procmail.org">Procmail</a>.

<P>
This document is a technical introduction intended for those
interested in developing Milter filters.  It includes:
<ul>
<li>A description of Milter's design goals.

<li>An explanation of Milter application architecture, including
interactions between the support library and user code, and between
filters and the MTA.

<li>A specification of the C application programming interface.
<li>An example of a simple Milter filter.
</ul>
