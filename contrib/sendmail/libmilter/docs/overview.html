<h2>Initialization</h2>

In addition to its own initialization, libmilter expects a filter to initialize several parameters before calling <a href="smfi_main.html">smfi_main</a>:
<ul>
    <li>The callbacks the filter wishes to be called, and the types of
    message modification it intends to perform (required, see <a
    href="smfi_register.html">smfi_register</a>).

    <li>The socket address to be used when communicating with the MTA
    (required, see <a href="smfi_setconn.html">smfi_setconn</a>).

    <li>The number of seconds to wait for MTA connections before
    timing out (optional, see <a
    href="smfi_settimeout.html">smfi_settimeout</a>).
</ul>
<p>
If the filter fails to initialize libmilter, or if one or more of the
parameters it has passed are invalid, a subsequent call to smfi_main
will fail.

<h2>Control flow</h2>

<p>
The following pseudocode describes the filtering process from the
perspective of a set of <code>N</code> MTA's, each corresponding to a
connection.  Callbacks are shown beside the processing stages in which
they are invoked; if no callbacks are defined for a particular stage,
that stage may be bypassed.  Though it is not shown, processing may be
aborted at any time during a message, in which case the <a
href="xxfi_abort.html">xxfi_abort</a> callback is invoked and control
returns to <code>MESSAGE</code>.
<p>
<pre>
For each of N connections
{
	For each filter
		process connection/helo (<a href="xxfi_connect.html">xxfi_connect</a>, <a href="xxfi_helo.html">xxfi_helo</a>)
MESSAGE:For each message in this connection (sequentially)
	{
		For each filter
			process sender (<a href="xxfi_envfrom.html">xxfi_envfrom</a>)
		For each recipient
		{
			For each filter
				process recipient (<a href="xxfi_envrcpt.html">xxfi_envrcpt</a>)
		}
		For each filter
		{
			For each header
				process header (<a href="xxfi_header.html">xxfi_header</a>)
			process end of headers (<a href="xxfi_eoh.html">xxfi_eoh</a>)
			For each body block
				process this body block (<a href="xxfi_body.html">xxfi_body</a>)
			process end of message (<a href="xxfi_eom.html">xxfi_eom</a>)
		}
	}
	For each filter
		process end of connection (<a href="xxfi_close.html">xxfi_close</a>)
}
</pre>

<P>Note: Filters are contacted in order defined in config file.</P>

<P>
To write a filter, a vendor supplies callbacks to process relevant
parts of a message transaction.  The library then controls all
sequencing, threading, and protocol exchange with the MTA.  <a
href="#figure-3">Figure 3</a> outlines control flow for a filter
process, showing where different callbacks are invoked.

<p>
Note that although only a single message is shown above, multiple
messages may be sent in a single connection.  Note also that a message
and/or connection may be aborted by either the remote host or the MTA
at any point during the SMTP transaction.  If this occurs during a
message (between the MAIL command and the final "."), the filter's <a
href="xxfi_abort.html">xxfi_abort</a> routine will be called.  <a
href="xxfi_close.html">xxfi_close</a> is called any time the
connection closes.

<h2>Multithreading</h2>

<p>
A single filter process may handle any number of connections
simultaneously.  All filtering callbacks must therefore be reentrant,
and use some appropriate external synchronization methods to access
global data. Furthermore, since there is not a one-to-one
correspondence between threads and connections (N connections mapped
onto M threads, M &lt;= N), connection-specific data must be accessed
through the handles provided by the Milter library.  The programmer
cannot rely on library-supplied thread-specific data blocks
(e.g. pthread_getspecific()) to store connection-specific data.  See
the API documentation for <a
href="smfi_setpriv.html">smfi_setpriv</a> and <a
href="smfi_getpriv.html">smfi_getpriv</a> for details.

<h2>Resource management</h2>

Since filters are likely to be long-lived, and to handle many
connections, proper deallocation of per-connection resources is
important.  The lifetime of a connection is bracketed by calls to the
callbacks <a href="xxfi_connect.html">xxfi_connect</a> and <a
href="xxfi_close.html">xxfi_close</a>.  Therefore connection-specific
resources (accessed via <a href="smfi_getpriv.html">smfi_getpriv</a>
and <a href="smfi_setpriv.html">smfi_setpriv</a>) may be allocated in
<a href="xxfi_connect.html">xxfi_connect</a>, and should be freed in
<a href="xxfi_close.html">xxfi_close</a>.  For further information see
the <a href="api.html#conn-msg">discussion</a> of message- versus
connection-oriented routines.  In particular, note that there is only
one connection-specific data pointer per connection.
<p>

Each message is bracketed by calls to <a
href="xxfi_envfrom.html">xxfi_envfrom</a> and <a
href="xxfi_eom.html">xxfi_eom</a> (or <a
href="xxfi_abort.html">xxfi_abort</a>), implying that message-specific
resources can be allocated and reclaimed in these routines.  Since the
messages in a connection are processed sequentially by each filter,
there will be only one active message associated with a given
connection and filter (and connection-private data block).  These
resources must still be accessed through <a
href="smfi_getpriv.html">smfi_getpriv</a> and <a
href="smfi_setpriv.html">smfi_setpriv</a>, and must be reclaimed
in <a href="xxfi_abort.html">xxfi_abort</a>.

<h2>Signal Handling</h2>

libmilter takes care of signal handling, the filters are
not influenced directly by signals.
There are basically two types of signal handlers:

<ol>
<li><TT>Stop</TT>: no new connections from the MTA will be accepted,
but existing connections are allowed to continue.
<li><TT>Abort</TT>: all filters will be stopped as soon as the next
communication with the MTA happens.
</ol>

Filters are not terminated asynchronously (except by
signals that can't be caught).
In the case of <TT>Abort</TT> the
<a href="xxfi_abort.html">xxfi_abort</a> callback is invoked.
