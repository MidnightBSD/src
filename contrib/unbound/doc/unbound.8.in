.TP
.B \-h
Show the version and commandline option help.
.TP
.B \-c\fI cfgfile
Set the config file with settings for unbound to read instead of reading the 
file at the default location, @ub_conf_file@. The syntax is
described in \fIunbound.conf\fR(5).
.TP
.B \-d
Debug flag, do not fork into the background, but stay attached to the
console. This flag will also delay writing to the logfile until the
thread\-spawn time. So that most config and setup errors appear on stderr.
.TP
.B \-v
Increase verbosity. If given multiple times, more information is logged.
This is in addition to the verbosity (if any) from the config file.
