          I still do not see a new version of cpio or at least extra
          patches that fix it so it works with the glibc. Thus, here is a
          simple patch to make it compile with glibc: diff -u

          The gnu version of CPIO appears to send all output to stderr.
          Take for instance a need to have the list of files copied and
          any errors separated as should be produced by the following:

          I have a new GNU/Linux system with large disks on which I need
          to generate cpio files for many different systems including
          older ones that don't support the "newc" format, only the "odc"
          format. The

          I have seen corrupted files as a result of using the
          pass-through option in cpio. The corruption occurs when
          active/in-use (and growing) files are being copied. The problem
          is that the file size has
