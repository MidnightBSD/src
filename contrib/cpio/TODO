Following is the list of cpio-related reports to bug-gnu-utils.
Many of them appear to be fixed, but quite a number of them is
probably still waiting for being handled.  The list is divided
into two parts, the messages are in somehow arbitrary order.

          Hi, I was wondering whether it was a bug or a feature that GNU
          cpio, while in copy-in mode, will create a multiply-linked set
          of files all of size 0 if the last linked file is not copied in

          Hello, Recently at OEone we fixed a bug in GNU cpio-2.4.2: When

          I have seen corrupted files as a result of using the
          pass-through option in cpio. The corruption occurs when
          active/in-use (and growing) files are being copied. The problem
          is that the file size has
