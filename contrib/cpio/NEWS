Version 2.0 adds the following features:

Support for the SVR4 cpio formats, which can store inodes >65535, and
for traditional and POSIX tar archives.  Also adds these options:

-A --append		append to instead of replacing the archive
-V --dot		print a dot for each file processed
-H --format		select archive format
-C --io-size		select I/O block size in bytes
-M --message		print a message at end of media volumes
--no-preserve-owner	don't change files' owners when extracting
-R --owner		set files' owners when extracting
-E --pattern-file	list of shell filename patterns to process
-s --swap-bytes		handle byte-order differences when extracting files
-S --swap-halfwords	ditto
-b			like -sS
-I			input archive filename
-k			recognize corrupted archives (we alawys do it, though)
-O			output archive filename

Some options of previous versions have been renamed in 2.0:

--binary was replaced by --format=bin
--portability was replaced by --format=odc

Some options have changed meaning in 2.0, for SVR4 compatibility:

-O used to select the binary archive format, now selects the output file
-V used to print the version number, now prints a dot for each file

Version 2.0 also fixes several bugs in the handling of files with
multiple links and of multi-volume archives on floppy disks.
