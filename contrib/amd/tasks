			  AM-UTILS-6.1 TASKS TODO

Please volunteer to do any of the following:

- autofs support: see README.autofs for details.

- deal with everything that has XXX on it in the sources
- documentation update ("XXX: FILL IN" sections).

- compatibility with Sun's automount maps?
	should be easier via the amd.conf file to specify type of map

- convert to using my own rpcgen .x files for amq/amq/nfs (v2 and v3)

- use packaging info for various OSs (such as RPM, Redhat Package Manager)

- $mindelay and $maxdelay in milliseconds

- multiple nfsl should be matched if one matched and nfs mount failed.  fall
  through.
- support multiple "fail-over read-only" NFS mounts in Solaris 2.6+.

- random nfs rhost:={srv1, srv2, srv3}

- nfslx, same as nfsl, but using linkx

- loadable info_*, amfs_*, and ops_* modules (lazy evaluation).

- hlfsd should daemonize even if -DDEBUG, then use -D nofork

- fixmount should use generic code from transp/transp_{tli,sockets}.c

- reverse notion of -F and other cmd-line options, so they override the
  amd.conf file (right now amd.conf overrides cmd-line options).

- add am-utils URL and COPYRIGHT to all distributed scripts and sources and
  programs etc. also to amq -v output.

- ion: browsable_dirs only works for nis if in [global] broken if it is file
  maps.

- browsable 'auto' style maps.

- mention signals in amd man page

- ALLOWED_MOUNT_TIME of 40 seconds is way too long!
- detecting down'ed hosts faster: use default portmap TTL variables?
- push get_nfs_version() down into a child process

- type:=program should not require umount command. can use default
  umount(). it works for smbmount/umount.

- document var[0-7] variables/selectors

- need a way to export a nfs-mount point after it is being mounted (jukebox
  mounts).  can do this with type:=program.

- support port=n, for machines that use NFS on a different port

- nfsl may be buggy when fs:= is specified explicitly (lockup?)

- y2k: amq /home (mounted time uses YY instead of YYYY)

- new amd.conf option to disable amq listener altogether (security)
	Should be available even if DEBUG is off.

- new amd.conf option dynamic_system_params to recompute osver, karch,
  etc. from uname() dynamically.

- solaris 8 doesn't pick up hsfs/pcfs/etc *_args structures and mount flags

- avoid having to compile ops_nfs3.o

- linux support for ext3

- be able to pass generic mount options to systems w/ a mount(2) that
  supports it (Linux).  Perhaps genopt="foo,bar" syntax.

- support several different nfs servers inside one nfsx entry

- reimplement the "parallel mounting" for multiple matching sub-entries

- fix amd.conf parser so it can parse key=value without spaces around the
  "=" sign.  Note this isn't so trivial because 'value' may include "="
  signs.

- NFSv4 support (such a short "tasks" entry given how much work it is :-)


* documentation
- document what can and what can't be a top-level mount type (i.e. a
  map-backed or map-holding type). Currently that's toplvl, auto, and
  direct.
- document how to add a direct map to amd.conf.

* autofs stuff
Linux:
- host mounts broken with autofs v3
- nfsx status unknown
- local filesystems (ufs, etc) status unknown

Solaris:
- host mounts status unknown
- nfsx status unknown
- local filesystems (ufs, etc) status unknown

FreeBSD:
- just do it

All:
- mntfs->mf_fo->opt_fs can contain garbage sometimes??
