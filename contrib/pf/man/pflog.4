.Sh NAME
.Nm pflog
.Nd packet filter logging interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "device pflog"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm pflog
interface is a pseudo-device which makes visible all packets logged by
the packet filter,
.Xr pf 4 .
Logged packets can easily be monitored in real
time by invoking
.Xr tcpdump 1
on the
.Nm
interface, or stored to disk using
.Xr pflogd 8 .
.Pp
Each packet retrieved on this interface has a header associated
with it of length
.Dv PFLOG_HDRLEN .
This header documents the address family, interface name, rule
number, reason, action, and direction of the packet that was logged.
This structure, defined in
.Aq Pa net/if_pflog.h
looks like
.Bd -literal -offset indent
struct pfloghdr {
	u_int8_t	length;
	sa_family_t	af;
	u_int8_t	action;
	u_int8_t	reason;
	char		ifname[IFNAMSIZ];
	char		ruleset[PF_RULESET_NAME_SIZE];
	u_int32_t	rulenr;
	u_int32_t	subrulenr;
	u_int8_t	dir;
	u_int8_t	pad[3];
};

.Sh EXAMPLES

# ifconfig pflog0 up
# tcpdump -n -e -ttt -i pflog0
