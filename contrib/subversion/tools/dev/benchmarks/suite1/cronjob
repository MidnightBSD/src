# This is the cronjob as run on our ASF box aka svn-qavm.
# It uses neels' mad bash script magic called 'pat' to update and
# build the latest trunk, invokes a benchmark and sends as mail.
#
# A word on 'pat': this is a grown-out-of-proportions bash script that holds
# all the small and large tasks that I do while developing on Subversion.
# While it works for me, it's not particularly beautifully coded --
# wouldn't publish it in Subversion's trunk, but if you want to find out
# what it does: http://hofmeyr.de/pat/
