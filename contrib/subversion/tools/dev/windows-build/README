Makefiles for automating the Windows build.

Should work either either nmake or GNU make.

Doesn't require Cygwin.

* TODO:
  - document: how to use
  - known bugs/shortcomings
  - separate the configurable parts to a Makefile.local.tmpl file
  - allow serf,httpd,neon,etc to be optional
  - auto-generate the list of individual targets from build.conf
    (that list is not used by the default make targets)
  - add 'make tools' to the default windows build

'cp' and friends can be obtained from gnuwin32.sf.net, unxutils.sf.net,
cygwin, etc.  Or tweak the makefile to use cp.pl or the built-in 'copy'
command instead.:
