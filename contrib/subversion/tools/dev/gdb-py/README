This directory includes a Python module which will integrate with gdb which
can be used to pretty-print various Subversion types.  For additional
information about gdb pretty-printing, see:

  http://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/Pretty-Printing.html


How to Use
----------
To enable pretty printing of selected Subversion types, put the following code
in your ~/.gdbinit:

[[[
python
import sys, os.path
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.expanduser('~/dev/svn-trunk/tools/dev/gdb-py'))
from svndbg.printers import register_libsvn_printers
register_libsvn_printers(None)
end
]]]

Change the path to point to the correct location on your platform for the
gdb-py directory, and then load gdb.  Everything should Just Work.
(I believe this requires gdb >= 7.0, but earlier versions may also work.)

The list of currently supported types for pretty printing is a bit lacking,
so should you run into a type which could be useful to be pretty printed,
read the documentation referenced above and follow the existing examples
to extend the pretty-printing support.  Enjoy!
