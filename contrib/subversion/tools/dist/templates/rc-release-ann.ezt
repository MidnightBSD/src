This is a pre-release for what will eventually become version [major-minor-patch] of the
Apache Subversion open source version control system.  It may contain known
issues, a complete list of [major-minor-patch]-blocking issues can be found
here:

    https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20SVN%20AND%20resolution%20%3D%20Unresolved%20AND%20fixVersion%20%3D%20[major-minor-patch]%20ORDER%20BY%20priority%20DESC%2C%20updated%20DESC

A pre-release means the Subversion developers feel that this release
is ready for widespread testing by the community.  There are known issues
(and unknown ones!), so please use it at your own risk, though we do
encourage people to test this release thoroughly.  Of particular note, please
remember that persistent data, such as the working copy or repository
formats may change before the final release, and there may not be an
upgrade path from the pre-releases to the final.

As a note to operating system distro packagers: while we wish to have this
release candidate widely tested, we do not feel that it is ready for packaging
and providing to end-users through a distro package system.  Packaging a
release candidate poses many problems, the biggest being that our policy lets
us break compatibility between the release candidate and the final release, if
we find something serious enough.  Having many users depending on a release
candidate through their distro would cause no end of pain and frustration that
we do not want to have to deal with.  However, if your distro has a branch that
is clearly labeled as containing experimental and often broken software, and
explicitly destined to consenting developers and integrators only, then we're
okay with packaging the release candidate there.  Just don't let it near the
end users please.
