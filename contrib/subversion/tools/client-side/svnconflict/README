svnconflict provides a non-interactive interface to SVN's conflict resolver.
It is intended for use by non-interactive merge scripts, which cannot easily
use interactive tree conflict resolution features provided by 'svn resolve'.

svnconflict operates on a single working copy path only. It is assumed that
scripts are able to discover conflicted paths in the working copy via other
means, such as 'svn status'.

The following operations are supported:

List conflicts at PATH: svnconflict list PATH
Show text-conflict resolution options for PATH: svnconflict options-text PATH
Show prop-conflict resolution options for PATH: svnconflict options-prop PATH
Show tree-conflict resolution options for PATH: svnconflict options-tree PATH
Resolve text conflict PATH: svnconflict resolve-text OPTION_ID PATH
Resolve prop conflict PATH: svnconflict resolve-prop PROPNAME OPTION_ID PATH
Resolve tree conflict PATH: svnconflict resolve-tree OPTION_ID PATH

Note that some advanced operations which are offered by 'svn resolve' are not
supported, such as selecting a move target path from a set of ambiguous move
target candidates. svnconflict will always use a default choice in such cases.

svnconflict may contact the repository to obtain information about a conflict.
It will never modify the repository, but only read information from it.
svnconflict will not prompt for credentials. If read-access to the repository
requires credentials but no suitable credentials are stored in Subversion's
authentication cache or provided on the command line, the operation may fail.
