Googlemock and Googletest Suite for Subversion
---------------------------------------------

Googlemock and Googletest are external packages that are downloaded
and compiled on request, as part of regular compilations.

Googlemock is available here:

    https://code.google.com/p/googlemock/

The source packages already include Googletest, which is available
here:

   https://code.google.com/p/googletest/

Subversion uses Googlemock and Googletest for the C++HL test suite.



To configure Subversion to use Googlemock, type

   ./get-dep.sh gmock

This will download Googlemock and put the fused source into the
'gmock-fused' directory. Once it's there, configure will pick it up
automatically (but you do have to re-run autogen.sh and configure).

You can disable building Googlemock (and hence the C++HL test suite)
with the --disable-gmock configure option. This will tell configure to
ignore the gmock-fused directory.
