/* Return TRUE iff @a pattern matches @a hostname as defined
 * by the matching rules of RFC 6125.  In the context of RFC
 * 6125 the pattern is the domain name portion of the presented
 * identifier (which comes from the Common Name or a DNSName
 * portion of the subjectAltName of an X.509 certificate) and
 * the hostname is the source domain (i.e. the host portion
 * of the URI the user entered).
 *
 * @note With respect to wildcards we only support matching
 * wildcards in the left-most label and as the only character
 * in the left-most label (i.e. we support RFC 6125 ยง 6.4.3
 * Rule 1 and 2 but not the optional Rule 3).  This may change
 * in the future.
 *
 * @note Subversion does not at current support internationalized
 * domain names.  Both values are presumed to be in NR-LDH label
 * or A-label form (see RFC 5890 for the definition).
 *
 * @since New in 1.9.
