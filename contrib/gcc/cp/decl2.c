       a waste of space.  

       There are two correctness issues, however: the address of a
       template instantiation with external linkage should be the
       same, independent of what translation unit asks for the
       address, and this will not hold when we emit multiple copies of
       the function.  However, there's little else we can do.  

       Also, by default, the typeinfo implementation assumes that
       there will be only one copy of the string used as the name for
       each type.  Therefore, if weak symbols are unavailable, the
       run-time library should perform a more conservative check; it
       should perform a string comparison, rather than an address
