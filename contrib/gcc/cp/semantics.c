/* Deferred Access Checking Overview
   ---------------------------------

   Most C++ expressions and declarations require access checking
   to be performed during parsing.  However, in several cases,
   this has to be treated differently.

   For member declarations, access checking has to be deferred
   until more information about the declaration is known.  For
   example:

     class A {
         typedef int X;
       public:
         X f();
     };

     A::X A::f();
     A::X g();

   When we are parsing the function return type `A::X', we don't
   really know if this is allowed until we parse the function name.

   Furthermore, some contexts require that access checking is
   never performed at all.  These include class heads, and template
   instantiations.

   Typical use of access checking functions is described here:
   
   1. When we enter a context that requires certain access checking
      mode, the function `push_deferring_access_checks' is called with
      DEFERRING argument specifying the desired mode.  Access checking
      may be performed immediately (dk_no_deferred), deferred
      (dk_deferred), or not performed (dk_no_check).

   2. When a declaration such as a type, or a variable, is encountered,
      the function `perform_or_defer_access_check' is called.  It
      maintains a TREE_LIST of all deferred checks.

   3. The global `current_class_type' or `current_function_decl' is then
      setup by the parser.  `enforce_access' relies on these information
      to check access.

   4. Upon exiting the context mentioned in step 1,
      `perform_deferred_access_checks' is called to check all declaration
      stored in the TREE_LIST.   `pop_deferring_access_checks' is then
      called to restore the previous access checking mode.

      In case of parsing error, we simply call `pop_deferring_access_checks'
      without `perform_deferred_access_checks'.  */
