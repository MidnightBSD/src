/* Each data type is represented by a tree node whose code is one of
   the following:  */
/* Each node that represents a data type has a component TYPE_SIZE
   containing a tree that is an expression for the size in bits.
   The TYPE_MODE contains the machine mode for values of this type.
   The TYPE_POINTER_TO field contains a type for a pointer to this type,
     or zero if no such has been created yet.
   The TYPE_NEXT_VARIANT field is used to chain together types
     that are variants made by type modifiers such as "const" and "volatile".
   The TYPE_MAIN_VARIANT field, in any member of such a chain,
     points to the start of the chain.
   The TYPE_NONCOPIED_PARTS field is a list specifying which parts
     of an object of this type should *not* be copied by assignment.
     The TREE_VALUE of each is a FIELD_DECL that should not be
     copied.  The TREE_PURPOSE is an initial value for that field when
     an object of this type is initialized via an INIT_EXPR.  It may
     be NULL if no special value is required.  Even the things in this
     list are copied if the right-hand side of an assignment is known
     to be a complete object (rather than being, perhaps, a subobject
     of some other object.)  The determination of what constitutes a
     complete object is done by fixed_type_p.
   The TYPE_NAME field contains info on the name used in the program
     for this type (for GDB symbol table output).  It is either a
     TYPE_DECL node, for types that are typedefs, or an IDENTIFIER_NODE
     in the case of structs, unions or enums that are known with a tag,
     or zero for types that have no special name.
   The TYPE_CONTEXT for any sort of type which could have a name or
    which could have named members (e.g. tagged types in C/C++) will
    point to the node which represents the scope of the given type, or
    will be NULL_TREE if the type has "file scope".  For most types, this
    will point to a BLOCK node or a FUNCTION_DECL node, but it could also
    point to a FUNCTION_TYPE node (for types whose scope is limited to the
    formal parameter list of some function type specification) or it
    could point to a RECORD_TYPE, UNION_TYPE or QUAL_UNION_TYPE node
    (for C++ "member" types).
    For non-tagged-types, TYPE_CONTEXT need not be set to anything in
    particular, since any type which is of some type category  (e.g.
    an array type or a function type) which cannot either have a name
    itself or have named members doesn't really have a "scope" per se.
  The TREE_CHAIN field is used as a forward-references to names for

/* Declarations.  All references to names are represented as ..._DECL
   nodes.  The decls in one binding context are chained through the
   TREE_CHAIN field.  Each DECL has a DECL_NAME field which contains
   an IDENTIFIER_NODE.  (Some decls, most often labels, may have zero
   as the DECL_NAME).  DECL_CONTEXT points to the node representing
   the context in which this declaration has its scope.  For
   FIELD_DECLs, this is the RECORD_TYPE, UNION_TYPE, or
   QUAL_UNION_TYPE node that the field is a member of.  For VAR_DECL,
   PARM_DECL, FUNCTION_DECL, LABEL_DECL, and CONST_DECL nodes, this
   points to either the FUNCTION_DECL for the containing function, the
   RECORD_TYPE or UNION_TYPE for the containing type, or NULL_TREE or
   a TRANSLATION_UNIT_DECL if the given decl has "file scope".
   DECL_ABSTRACT_ORIGIN, if non-NULL, points to the original (abstract)
    ..._DECL node of which this decl is an (inlined or template expanded)
    instance.
   The TREE_TYPE field holds the data type of the object, when relevant.
    LABEL_DECLs have no data type.  For TYPE_DECL, the TREE_TYPE field
    contents are the type whose name is being declared.
   The DECL_ALIGN, DECL_SIZE,
    and DECL_MODE fields exist in decl nodes just as in type nodes.
    They are unused in LABEL_DECL, TYPE_DECL and CONST_DECL nodes.

   DECL_FIELD_BIT_OFFSET holds an integer number of bits offset for
   the location.  DECL_VOFFSET holds an expression for a variable
   offset; it is to be multiplied by DECL_VOFFSET_UNIT (an integer).
   These fields are relevant only in FIELD_DECLs and PARM_DECLs.

   DECL_INITIAL holds the value to initialize a variable to,
   or the value of a constant.  For a function, it holds the body
   (a node of type BLOCK representing the function's binding contour
   and whose body contains the function's statements.)  For a LABEL_DECL
   in C, it is a flag, nonzero if the label's definition has been seen.

   PARM_DECLs use a special field:
   DECL_ARG_TYPE is the type in which the argument is actually
    passed, which may be different from its type within the function.

   FUNCTION_DECLs use four special fields:
   DECL_ARGUMENTS holds a chain of PARM_DECL nodes for the arguments.
   DECL_RESULT holds a RESULT_DECL node for the value of a function,
    or it is 0 for a function that returns no value.
    (C functions returning void have zero here.)
    The TREE_TYPE field is the type in which the result is actually
    returned.  This is usually the same as the return type of the
    FUNCTION_DECL, but it may be a wider integer type because of
    promotion.
   DECL_FUNCTION_CODE is a code number that is nonzero for
    built-in functions.  Its value is an enum built_in_function
    that says which built-in function it is.

   DECL_SOURCE_FILE holds a filename string and DECL_SOURCE_LINE
   holds a line number.  In some cases these can be the location of
   a reference, if no definition has been seen.

   DECL_ABSTRACT is nonzero if the decl represents an abstract instance
   of a decl (i.e. one which is nested within an abstract instance of a
   inline function.  */

/* The following two codes are used in languages that have types where
   some field in an object of the type contains a value that is used in
   the computation of another field's offset or size and/or the size of
   the type.  The positions and/or sizes of fields can vary from object
   to object of the same type or even for one and the same object within
   its scope.

   Record types with discriminants in Ada or schema types in Pascal are
   examples of such types.  This mechanism is also used to create "fat
   pointers" for unconstrained array types in Ada; the fat pointer is a
   structure one of whose fields is a pointer to the actual array type
   and the other field is a pointer to a template, which is a structure
   containing the bounds of the array.  The bounds in the type pointed
   to by the first field in the fat pointer refer to the values in the
   template.

   When you wish to construct such a type you need "self-references"
   that allow you to reference the object having this type from the
   TYPE node, i.e. without having a variable instantiating this type.

   Such a "self-references" is done using a PLACEHOLDER_EXPR.  This is
   a node that will later be replaced with the object being referenced.
   Its type is that of the object and selects which object to use from
   a chain of references (see below).  No other slots are used in the
   PLACEHOLDER_EXPR.

   For example, if your type FOO is a RECORD_TYPE with a field BAR,
   and you need the value of <variable>.BAR to calculate TYPE_SIZE
   (FOO), just substitute <variable> above with a PLACEHOLDER_EXPR
   whose TREE_TYPE is FOO.  Then construct your COMPONENT_REF with
   the PLACEHOLDER_EXPR as the first operand (which has the correct
   type).  Later, when the size is needed in the program, the back-end
   will find this PLACEHOLDER_EXPR and generate code to calculate the
   actual size at run-time.  In the following, we describe how this
   calculation is done.

   When we wish to evaluate a size or offset, we check whether it
   contains a PLACEHOLDER_EXPR.  If it does, we construct a
   WITH_RECORD_EXPR that contains both the expression we wish to
   evaluate and an expression within which the object may be found.
   The latter expression is the object itself in the simple case of an
   Ada record with discriminant, but it can be the array in the case of
   an unconstrained array.

   In the latter case, we need the fat pointer, because the bounds of
   the array can only be accessed from it.  However, we rely here on the
   fact that the expression for the array contains the dereference of
   the fat pointer that obtained the array pointer.

   Accordingly, when looking for the object to substitute in place of
   a PLACEHOLDER_EXPR, we look down the first operand of the expression
   passed as the second operand to WITH_RECORD_EXPR until we find
   something of the desired type or reach a constant.  */
