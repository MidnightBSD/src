; This file is processed by the script opts.sh.  It is a database of
; command line options, with each record separated by a blank line,
; and each field appearing on its own line.  The first field is the
; command-line switch with the leading "-" removed.  All options
; beginning with "f" or "W" are implicitly assumed to take a "no-"
; form; this form should not be listed.  If you do not want this
; negative form and you want it to be automatically rejected, add
; RejectNegative to the second field.

; The second field is a space-separated list of which parts of the
; compiler recognize the switch, as declared by "Language" entries.
; If the switch takes an argument, then you should also specify
; "Joined" and/or "Separate" to indicate where the argument can
; appear.  If a Joined argument can legitimately be omitted, specify
; "JoinedOrMissing" instead of "Joined".  If the argument to a switch
; is a non-negative integer, you can specify "UInteger" and the switch
; decoder will convert the argument for you, or complain to the user
; if the argument is invalid.

; The third field is the help text to output with --help.  This is
; automatically line-wrapped on output.  Normally the switch is output
; automatically, with the help text on the right hand side of the
; output.  However, if the help text contains a tab character, the
; text to the left of the tab is output instead of the switch, and the
; text to its right forms the help.  This is useful for elaborating on
; what type of argument a switch takes, for example.  If the second
; field contains "Undocumented" then nothing is output with --help.
; Only do this with good reason like the switch being internal between
; the driver and the front end - it is not an excuse to leave a switch
; undocumented.

; Comments can appear on their own line anwhere in the file, preceded
; by a semicolon.  Whitespace is permitted before the semicolon.

; For each switch XXX below, an enumeration constant is created by the
; script opts.sh spelt OPT_XXX, but with all non-alphanumeric
; characters replaced with an underscore.

; Please try to keep this file in ASCII collating order.
