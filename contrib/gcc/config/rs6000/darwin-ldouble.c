/* Implementations of floating-point long double basic arithmetic
   functions called by the IBM C compiler when generating code for
   PowerPC platforms.  In particular, the following functions are
   implemented: _xlqadd, _xlqsub, _xlqmul, and _xlqdiv.  Double-double
   algorithms are based on the paper "Doubled-Precision IEEE Standard
   754 Floating-Point Arithmetic" by W. Kahan, February 26, 1987.  An
   alternative published reference is "Software for Doubled-Precision
   Floating-Point Computations", by Seppo Linnainmaa, ACM TOMS vol 7
   no 3, September 1961, pages 272-283.  */

/* Each long double is made up of two IEEE doubles.  The value of the
   long double is the sum of the values of the two parts.  The most
   significant part is required to be the value of the long double
   rounded to the nearest double, as specified by IEEE.  For Inf
   values, the least significant part is required to be one of +0.0 or
   -0.0.  No other requirements are made; so, for example, 1.0 may be
   represented as (1.0, +0.0) or (1.0, -0.0), and the low part of a
   NaN is don't-care.

   This code currently assumes big-endian.  */
