/* Each c_scope structure describes the complete contents of one scope.
   Three scopes are distinguished specially: the innermost or current
   scope, the innermost function scope, and the outermost or file scope.

   Most declarations are recorded in the current scope.

   All normal label declarations are recorded in the innermost
   function scope, as are bindings of undeclared identifiers to
   error_mark_node.  (GCC permits nested functions as an extension,
   hence the 'innermost' qualifier.)  Explicitly declared labels
   (using the __label__ extension) appear in the current scope.

   Being in the global scope (current_scope == global_scope) causes
   special behavior in several places below.  Also, under some
   conditions the Objective-C front end records declarations in the
   global scope even though that isn't the current scope.

   The order of the names, parms, and blocks lists matters, and they
   are frequently appended to.  To avoid having to walk all the way to
   the end of the list on each insertion, or reverse the lists later,
   we maintain a pointer to the last list entry for each of the lists.

   The order of the tags, shadowed, and shadowed_tags

/* Subroutine of pushdecl.

   X is a TYPE_DECL for a typedef statement.  Create a brand new
   ..._TYPE node (which will be just a variant of the existing
   ..._TYPE node with identical properties) and then install X
   as the TYPE_NAME of this brand new (duplicate) ..._TYPE node.

   The whole point here is to end up with a situation where each
   and every ..._TYPE node the compiler creates will be uniquely
   associated with AT MOST one node representing a typedef name.
   This way, even though the compiler substitutes corresponding
   ..._TYPE nodes for TYPE_DECL (i.e. "typedef name") nodes very
   early on, later parts of the compiler can always do the reverse
   translation and get back the corresponding typedef name.  For
   example, given:

        typedef struct S MY_TYPE;
	MY_TYPE object;

   Later parts of the compiler might only know that `object' was of
   type `struct S' if it were not for code just below.  With this
   code however, later parts of the compiler see something like:

	struct S' == struct S
	typedef struct S' MY_TYPE;
	struct S' object;

    And they can then deduce (from the node for type struct S') that
    the original object declaration was:

		MY_TYPE object;

    Being able to do this is important for proper support of protoize,
    and also for generating precise symbolic debugging information
    which takes full account of the programmer's (typedef) vocabulary.

    Obviously, we don't want to generate a duplicate ..._TYPE node if
    the TYPE_DECL node that we are now processing really represents a
    standard built-in type.

    Since all standard types are effectively declared at line zero
    in the source file, we can easily check to see if we are working
    on a standard type by checking the current value of lineno.  */

     TYPENAME if for a typename (in a cast or sizeof).
      Don't make a DECL node; just return the ..._TYPE node.
     FIELD for a struct or union field; make a FIELD_DECL.
   INITIALIZED is 1 if the decl has an initializer.
   WIDTH is non-NULL for bit-fields, and is a pointer to an INTEGER_CST node
   representing the width of the bit-field.
