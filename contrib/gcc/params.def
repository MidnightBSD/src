/* This file contains definitions for language-independent
   parameters.  The DEFPARAM macro takes 4 arguments:

     - The enumeral corresponding to this parameter.

     - The name that can be used to set this parameter using the 
       command-line option `--param <name>=<value>'.

     - A help string explaining how the parameter is used.

     - A default value for the parameter.

   Be sure to add an entry to invoke.texi summarizing the parameter.  */

   of a function counted in internal gcc instructions (not in
   real machine instructions) that is eligible for inlining

   Only functions marked inline (or methods defined in the class
   definition for C++) are affected by this, unless you set the
   -finline-functions (included in -O3) compiler option.
   There are more restrictions to inlining: If inlined functions
   call other functions, the already inlined instructions are

   "max-inline-insns" parameter) is exceeded, the acceptable size
   gets decreased.  */
