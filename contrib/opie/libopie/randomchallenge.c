        History:

	Modified by cmetz for OPIE 2.4. Use snprintf().
	Modified by cmetz for OPIE 2.32. Initialize algids[] with 0s
	     instead of NULL.
        Modified by cmetz for OPIE 2.3. Add sha support.
	Modified by cmetz for OPIE 2.22. Don't include stdio.h.
	     Use opienewseed(). Don't include unneeded headers.
	Modified by cmetz for OPIE 2.2. Use FUNCTION declaration et al.
             Changed use of gethostname() to uname(). Ifdefed around some
