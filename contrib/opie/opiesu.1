.SH NAME
opiesu \- Replacement su(1) program that uses OPIE challenges
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B opiesu
[ \-f ] [ \-c ] [
.I user_name
] 
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I opiesu
is a replacement for the su(1) program that issues OPIE challenges and
uses OPIE responses. It is downward compatible with keysu(1) from the
Bellcore S/Key Version 1 distribution and the su(1) program from the 4.3BSD
Net/2 distribution.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-f
If the invoked shell is csh(1),  this option prevents it from
reading the ``.cshrc'' file.  (The [f] option may be passed as a
shell argument after the login name, so this option is redundant
and obsolescent.)
.TP
.B \-c
Set console mode where the user is expected to have secure access to the
system. In console mode, you will be asked to input your password directly
instead of having to use an OPIE calculator. If you do not have secure access
to the system (i.e., you are not on the system's console), you are
volunteering your password to attackers by using this mode.
.TP
.I user_name
The name of the user to become.
The default is root.
