.SH NAME
opiepasswd \-  Change or set a user's password for the OPIE authentication 
system.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B opiepasswd 
[\-v] [\-h] [\-c|\-d] [\-f]
.sp 0
[\-n
.I initial_sequence_number
]
[\-s 
.I seed 
] [
.I user_name
] 

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I opiepasswd
will initialize the system information to allow one to use OPIE to login.
.I opiepasswd
is downward compatible with the keyinit(1) program from the
Bellcore S/Key Version 1 distribution.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.TP
.B \-v
Display the version number and compile-time options, then exit.
.TP
.B \-h
Display a brief help message and exit.
.TP
.B \-c
Set console mode where the user is expected to have secure access to the
system. In console mode, you will be asked to input your password directly
instead of having to use an OPIE calculator. If you do not have secure access
to the system (i.e., you are not on the system's console), you are
volunteering your password to attackers by using this mode.
.TP
.B \-d
Disable OTP logins to the specified account.
.TP
.B \-f
Force
.I opiepasswd
to continue, even where it normally shouldn't. This is currently used to
force opiepasswd to operate in "console" mode even from terminals it believes
to be insecure. It can also allow users to disclose their secret pass phrases
to attackers. Use of the -f flag may be disabled by compile-time option in
your particular build of OPIE.
.TP
.B \-n
Manually specify the initial sequence number. The default is 499.
.TP
.B \-s
Specify a non-random seed. The default is to generate a "random" seed using 
the first two characters of the host name and five pseudo-random digits.
.SH EXAMPLE

.I opiepasswd
