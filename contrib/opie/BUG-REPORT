OPIE Software Distribution, Release 2.4                      Bug Reporting Form
=======================================                      ==================

	Before submitting a bug report, please check the README file and make
sure that your "bug" is not a known problem.

	Please make a copy of this file and then edit it with your favorite
text editor (NOT a word processor; the end result needs to be reasonable ASCII
text) to include the answers to the following questions:

1. Your name and electronic mail address, in case we need more information.
	If you can provide multiple addresses, please do so in case we
	are unable to reply to the first one.

2. Your exact operating system vendor, name, and version number. If available,
        please provide the output of "uname -a" and/or the version of your C
        runtime library. Please be more specific than "UNIX".

3. The exact hardware the system was installed upon.

4. Which compiler and C runtime you used and its version number.
	For instance, some systems have been known to have the GNU libc
	installed as well as its native one, or to have a "BSD
	compatibility" environment.

5. What version of OPIE you are using (the output of opiepasswd -v) and,
	if you used the Autoconf install, a copy of the config.h, config.log,
	and Makefile that Autoconf created.

6. A clear description of what you did and what bug then appeared.
	If your system has the script(1) command, please run a session
	under that to demonstrate the bug. Window-system cut-and-paste
	also works well. Sometimes, the exact output is critical to
	finding the bug.

If you can provide any of the following things, it will greatly assist
us in fixing the problem and improve the chances that we'll get back to you:

7. A diagnosis of what is causing the problem.

8. A test case that can repeatably demonstrate the problem.

9. A fix for the problem.

	Bug reports should be sent by Internet electronic mail to 
<opie-bugs@inner.net>. This mail is run through an automated sorter that helps
get the bug report into the hands of someone who can help you. In order to
make that program work, we ask that you:

	* Send this is normal RFC822 plain text or MIME text/plain.

	* DO NOT send this or any other file as an "attachment" from
	  your mailer.

	* DO NOT send a copy of your bug report to ANYONE other than
	  <opie-bugs@inner.net>. This includes listing more than one recipient
          or sending it as a carbon-copy ("Cc:") to someone else.

	* DO NOT send a copy of your bug report directly to the
	  authors or to any mailing lists. This really makes the
	  authors angry, and will be interpreted as a request to not
	  provide you with any help.

	* DO NOT re-send bug reports because you didn't receive a
	  response. We attempt to respond to ALL properly submitted
	  bug reports. If we can't send mail back to you or you
	  didn't bother to follow the directions for submitting a
	  bug report, you won't receive a response.

	While OPIE is NOT a supported program, we generally try to respond
to all properly submitted bug reports as soon as we can. If your bug report
is properly submitted so our machine sorter can process it, this usually
takes one working day. If our machine sorter can't process your bug report,
it usually takes a week or two.
