.SH NAME
opielogin \- Replacement for login(1) that issues OPIE challenges.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B opielogin 
[ -p ] [ -r 
.I hostname
| -h 
.I hostname
| -f
.I username
.sp 0
| 
.I username
]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I opielogin
provides a replacement for the 
.IR login (1)
program that provides OPIE challenges
to users and accepts OPIE responses. It is downward compatible with the 
.IR keylogin(1)
program from the Bellcore S/Key Version 1 distribution, which, in
turn, is downward compatible with the
.IR login(1)
program from the 4.3BSD Net/2 distribution.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-p
By default, login discards any previous environment.  The \-p 
option disables this behavior.
.TP
.B \-r
Process remote login from 
.I hostname.
.TP
.B \-h
The -h option specifies the host from which the connection was
received.  It is used by various daemons such as telnetd(8).
This option may only be used by the super\-user.
.TP
.B \-f
The -f option is used when a user name is specified to indicate
that proper authentication has already been done and that no
password need be requested.  This option may only be used by the
super\-user or when an already logged in user is logging in as
themselves.
.TP
.I username
The user name to log in as.
