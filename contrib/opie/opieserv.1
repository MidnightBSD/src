.SH NAME
opieserv \- Example OPIE-based OTP server

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B opieserv
.sp 0
[
.I principal
]
.sp 0

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I opieserv
takes an OTP principal (e.g., a user name) from either the command line or
standard input and returns a current OTP challenge for that principal. It then 
reads an OTP response to that challenge from standard input and displays a
message and returns a value to indicate either success (exit value = 0) or
failure (exit value = 1). It is intended as an example for programmers
of how a simple OTP server can be built.
