.SH NAME
/etc/opiekeys \- OPIE database of user key information

.SH DESCRIPTION
The 
.I opiekeys
file contains user information used by the OPIE software to authenticate
users. The 
.I opiekeys
file is backwards compatible with the S/Key 
.I /etc/skeykeys
database file, but only if the hashing algorithm (MD4 and MD5) is the same
between S/Key and OPIE (i.e., MD5 OPIE cannot use MD4 S/Key keys). The
.I opiekeys
file consists of six fields separated by spaces (tabs are properly 
interpreted, but spaces should be used instead) as follows:
.PP
.nf
.ta \w'              'u
Field   	Description
name    	User's login name.
sequence	User's sequence number.
seed    	User's seed.
key     	User's last response (hex).
date    	Last change date.
time    	Last change time.
