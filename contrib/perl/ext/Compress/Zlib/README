DESCRIPTION
-----------


This module provides a Perl interface to the zlib compression library.  





PREREQUISITES
-------------

Before you can build Compress-Zlib you need to have the following
installed on your system:


    * Perl 5.004 or better. 
    * Compress::Raw::Zlib
    * IO::Compress::Gzip





BUILDING THE MODULE
-------------------

Assuming you have met all the prerequisites, the module can now be built
using this sequence of commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test



INSTALLATION
------------

To install Compress-Zlib, run the command below:

    make install





TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------


Undefined Symbol gzsetparams
----------------------------

If you get the error shown below when you run the Compress-Zlib test
harness it probably means you are running a copy of zlib that is
version 1.0.5 or older.

t/01version.........Can't load 'blib/arch/auto/Compress/Zlib/Zlib.so' for 
                    module Compress::Raw::Zlib: blib/arch/auto/Compress/Raw/Zlib/Zlib.so:
                    undefined symbol: gzsetparams at ...

There are two ways to fix this problem:

    1. Upgrade to the latest version of zlib.

    2. Edit config.in and set the OLD_ZLIB variable to True.



Test Harness 01version fails
----------------------------
If the 01version test harness fails, and the problem isn't covered by the
scenario above, it probably means that you have two versions of 
zlib installed on your system.

Run the command below to see if this is indeed the case

    make test TEST_VERBOSE=1 TEST_FILES=t/01version.t 

Try removing the one you don't want to use and rebuild.   









FEEDBACK
--------

How to report a problem with Compress-Zlib.

To help me help you, I need all of the following information:

 1. The Versions of everything relevant.
    This includes:

     a. The *complete* output from running this
     
            perl -V
     
        Do not edit the output in any way.
        Note, I want you to run "perl -V" and NOT "perl -v".
     
        If your perl does not understand the "-V" option it is too
        old. This module needs Perl version 5.004 or better.     

     b. The version of Compress-Zlib you have. 
        If you have successfully installed Compress-Zlib, this one-liner
        will tell you:

           perl -MCompress::Zlib -e 'print qq[ver $Compress::Zlib::VERSION\n]'

        If you are  running windows use this

           perl -MCompress::Zlib -e "print qq[ver $Compress::Zlib::VERSION\n]"

        If you haven't installed Compress-Zlib then search Compress::Zlib.pm
        for a line like this:

          $VERSION = "2.008" ;



 2. If you are having problems building Compress-Zlib, send me a
    complete log of what happened. Start by unpacking the Compress-Zlib
    module into a fresh directory and keep a log of all the steps

        [edit config.in, if necessary]
        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test TEST_VERBOSE=1
