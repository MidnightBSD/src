#* Alternation

# BRANCH        The set of branches constituting a single choice are hooked
#               together with their "next" pointers, since precedence prevents
#               anything being concatenated to any individual branch.  The
#               "next" pointer of the last BRANCH in a choice points to the
#               thing following the whole choice.  This is also where the
#               final "next" pointer of each individual branch points; each
#               branch starts with the operand node of a BRANCH node.
#
BRANCH      BRANCH,     node 0 V  ; Match this alternative, or the next...

#*Back pointer

# BACK          Normal "next" pointers all implicitly point forward; BACK
#               exists to make loop structures possible.
# not used
BACK        BACK,       no 0 V    ; Match "", "next" ptr points backward.

#*Literals

EXACT       EXACT,      str       ; Match this string (preceded by length).
EXACTF      EXACT,      str       ; Match this string, folded, native charset semantics for non-utf8 (prec. by length).
EXACTFL     EXACT,      str       ; Match this string, folded in locale (w/len).
EXACTFU     EXACT,      str	  ; Match this string, folded, Unicode semantics for non-utf8 (prec. by length).
EXACTFA     EXACT,      str	  ; Match this string, folded, Unicode semantics for non-utf8, but no ASCII-range character matches outside ASCII (prec. by length),.

# A variant of above which delimits a group, thus stops optimizations
TAIL        NOTHING,    no        ; Match empty string. Can jump here from outside.

#*Loops

# STAR,PLUS    '?', and complex '*' and '+', are implemented as circular
#               BRANCH structures using BACK.  Simple cases (one character
#               per match) are implemented with STAR and PLUS for speed
#               and to minimize recursive plunges.
#
