perlapi - autogenerated documentation for the perl public API

=head1 DESCRIPTION
X<Perl API> X<API> X<api>

This file contains the documentation of the perl public API generated by
embed.pl, specifically a listing of functions, macros, flags, and variables
that may be used by extension writers.  The interfaces of any functions that
are not listed here are subject to change without notice.  For this reason,
blindly using functions listed in proto.h is to be avoided when writing
extensions.

Note that all Perl API global variables must be referenced with the C<PL_>
prefix.  Some macros are provided for compatibility with the older,
unadorned names, but this support may be disabled in a future release.

The listing is alphabetical, case insensitive.

=for hackers
Found in file av.c

=item av_exists
X<av_exists>

Returns true if the element indexed by C<key> has been initialized.

X<av_fetch>

Returns the SV at the specified index in the array.  The C<key> is the
index.  If C<lval> is set then the fetch will be part of a store.  Check
that the return value is non-null before dereferencing it to a C<SV*>.

See L<perlguts/"Understanding the Magic of Tied Hashes and Arrays"> for
more information on how to use this function on tied arrays.

=item av_fill
X<av_fill>

Set the highest index in the array to the given number, equivalent to
Perl's C<$#array = $fill;>.

The number of elements in the an array will be C<fill + 1> after
av_fill() returns.  If the array was previously shorter then the
additional elements appended are set to C<PL_sv_undef>.  If the array
was longer, then the excess elements are freed.  C<av_fill(av, -1)> is
the same as C<av_clear(av)>.

	void	av_fill(AV* ar, I32 fill)

=for hackers
Found in file av.c

=item av_len
X<av_len>

X<av_shift>

Shifts an SV off the beginning of the array.

	SV*	av_shift(AV* ar)

=for hackers
Found in file av.c

=item av_store
X<av_store>

Stores an SV in an array.  The array index is specified as C<key>.  The
return value will be NULL if the operation failed or if the value did not
need to be actually stored within the array (as in the case of tied
arrays). Otherwise it can be dereferenced to get the original C<SV*>.  Note
that the caller is responsible for suitably incrementing the reference
count of C<val> before the call, and decrementing it if the function
returned NULL.

See L<perlguts/"Understanding the Magic of Tied Hashes and Arrays"> for
more information on how to use this function on tied arrays.

	SV**	av_store(AV* ar, I32 key, SV* val)

=head1 Cloning an interpreter

=over 8

=item perl_clone
X<perl_clone>

Create and return a new interpreter by cloning the current one.

perl_clone takes these flags as parameters:

CLONEf_COPY_STACKS - is used to, well, copy the stacks also,
without it we only clone the data and zero the stacks,
with it we copy the stacks and the new perl interpreter is
ready to run at the exact same point as the previous one.
The pseudo-fork code uses COPY_STACKS while the
threads->create doesn't.

CLONEf_KEEP_PTR_TABLE
perl_clone keeps a ptr_table with the pointer of the old
variable as a key and the new variable as a value,
this allows it to check if something has been cloned and not
clone it again but rather just use the value and increase the
refcount. If KEEP_PTR_TABLE is not set then perl_clone will kill
the ptr_table using the function
C<ptr_table_free(PL_ptr_table); PL_ptr_table = NULL;>,
reason to keep it around is if you want to dup some of your own
variable who are outside the graph perl scans, example of this
code is in threads.xs create

CLONEf_CLONE_HOST
This is a win32 thing, it is ignored on unix, it tells perls
win32host code (which is c++) to clone itself, this is needed on
win32 if you want to run two threads at the same time,
if you just want to do some stuff in a separate perl interpreter
and then throw it away and return to the original one,
you don't need to do anything.

	CV*	get_cv(const char* name, I32 flags)

=for hackers

=item get_cvn_flags
X<get_cvn_flags>

Returns the CV of the specified Perl subroutine.  C<flags> are passed to
C<gv_fetchpvn_flags>. If C<GV_ADD> is set and the Perl subroutine does not
exist then it will be declared (which has the same effect as saying
C<sub name;>).  If C<GV_ADD> is not set and the subroutine does not exist
then NULL is returned.

Eg, "Foo::Bar" instead of "Foo/Bar.pm".  flags can be any of
PERL_LOADMOD_DENY, PERL_LOADMOD_NOIMPORT, or PERL_LOADMOD_IMPORT_OPS
(or 0 for no flags). ver, if specified, provides version semantics
similar to C<use Foo::Bar VERSION>.  The optional trailing SV*
arguments can be used to specify arguments to the module's import()
method, similar to C<use Foo::Bar VERSION LIST>.

  char *pv_display(SV *dsv, const char *pv, STRLEN cur, STRLEN len,
                   STRLEN pvlim, U32 flags)

Similar to

  pv_escape(dsv,pv,cur,pvlim,PERL_PV_ESCAPE_QUOTE);

except that an additional "\0" will be appended to the string when
len > cur and pv[cur] is "\0".

Note that the final string may be up to 7 chars longer than pvlim.

	char*	pv_display(SV *dsv, const char *pv, STRLEN cur, STRLEN len, STRLEN pvlim)

X<pv_escape>

               |const STRLEN count|const STRLEN max
               |STRLEN const *escaped, const U32 flags

Escapes at most the first "count" chars of pv and puts the results into
dsv such that the size of the escaped string will not exceed "max" chars
and will not contain any incomplete escape sequences.

If flags contains PERL_PV_ESCAPE_QUOTE then any double quotes in the string
will also be escaped.

Normally the SV will be cleared before the escaped string is prepared,
but when PERL_PV_ESCAPE_NOCLEAR is set this will not occur.

If PERL_PV_ESCAPE_UNI is set then the input string is treated as Unicode,
if PERL_PV_ESCAPE_UNI_DETECT is set then the input string is scanned
using C<is_utf8_string()> to determine if it is Unicode.

If PERL_PV_ESCAPE_ALL is set then all input chars will be output
using C<\x01F1> style escapes, otherwise only chars above 255 will be
escaped using this style, other non printable chars will use octal or
common escaped patterns like C<\n>. If PERL_PV_ESCAPE_NOBACKSLASH
then all chars below 255 will be treated as printable and 
will be output as literals.

If PERL_PV_ESCAPE_FIRSTCHAR is set then only the first char of the
string will be escaped, regardles of max. If the string is utf8 and 
the chars value is >255 then it will be returned as a plain hex 
sequence. Thus the output will either be a single char, 
an octal escape sequence, a special escape like C<\n> or a 3 or 
more digit hex value. 

If PERL_PV_ESCAPE_RE is set then the escape char used will be a '%' and
not a '\\'. This is because regexes very often contain backslashed
sequences, whereas '%' is not a particularly common character in patterns.

Returns a pointer to the escaped text as held by dsv.

NOTE: the perl_ form of this function is deprecated.

           |const char const *start_color| const char const *end_color\
           |const U32 flags

Converts a string into something presentable, handling escaping via
pv_escape() and supporting quoting and ellipses.

If the PERL_PV_PRETTY_QUOTE flag is set then the result will be 
double quoted with any double quotes in the string escaped. Otherwise
if the PERL_PV_PRETTY_LTGT flag is set then the result be wrapped in
angle brackets. 
           
If the PERL_PV_PRETTY_ELLIPSES flag is set and not all characters in
string were output then an ellipsis C<...> will be appended to the
string. Note that this happens AFTER it has been quoted.
           
If start_color is non-null then it will be inserted after the opening
quote (if there is one) but before the escaped text. If end_color
is non-null then it will be inserted after the escaped text but before
any quotes or ellipses.

Returns a pointer to the prettified text as held by dsv.

=item gv_const_sv
X<gv_const_sv>

If C<gv> is a typeglob whose subroutine entry is a constant sub eligible for
inlining, or C<gv> is a placeholder reference that would be promoted to such
a typeglob, then returns the value returned by the sub.  Otherwise, returns
NULL.

	SV*	gv_const_sv(GV* gv)

=for hackers
Found in file gv.c

=item gv_fetchmeth
X<gv_fetchmeth>

Returns the glob with the given C<name> and a defined subroutine or
C<NULL>.  The glob lives in the given C<stash>, or in the stashes
accessible via @ISA and UNIVERSAL::.

The argument C<level> should be either 0 or -1.  If C<level==0>, as a
side-effect creates a glob with the given C<name> in the given C<stash>
which in the case of success contains an alias for the subroutine, and sets
up caching info for this glob.

This function grants C<"SUPER"> token as a postfix of the stash name. The
GV returned from C<gv_fetchmeth> may be a method cache entry, which is not
visible to Perl code.  So when calling C<call_sv>, you should not use
the GV directly; instead, you should use the method's CV, which can be
obtained from the GV with the C<GvCV> macro.

	GV*	gv_fetchmeth(HV* stash, const char* name, STRLEN len, I32 level)

=for hackers
Found in file gv.c

=item gv_fetchmethod_autoload
X<gv_fetchmethod_autoload>

Returns the glob which contains the subroutine to call to invoke the method
on the C<stash>.  In fact in the presence of autoloading this may be the
glob for "AUTOLOAD".  In this case the corresponding variable $AUTOLOAD is
already setup.

The third parameter of C<gv_fetchmethod_autoload> determines whether
AUTOLOAD lookup is performed if the given method is not present: non-zero
means yes, look for AUTOLOAD; zero means no, don't look for AUTOLOAD.
Calling C<gv_fetchmethod> is equivalent to calling C<gv_fetchmethod_autoload>
with a non-zero C<autoload> parameter.

These functions grant C<"SUPER"> token as a prefix of the method name. Note
that if you want to keep the returned glob for a long time, you need to
check for it being "AUTOLOAD", since at the later time the call may load a
different subroutine due to $AUTOLOAD changing its value. Use the glob
created via a side effect to do this.

These functions have the same side-effects and as C<gv_fetchmeth> with
C<level==0>.  C<name> should be writable if contains C<':'> or C<'
''>. The warning against passing the GV returned by C<gv_fetchmeth> to
C<call_sv> apply equally to these functions.

	GV*	gv_fetchmethod_autoload(HV* stash, const char* name, I32 autoload)

=for hackers

=item gv_fetchmeth_autoload
X<gv_fetchmeth_autoload>

Same as gv_fetchmeth(), but looks for autoloaded subroutines too.
Returns a glob for the subroutine.

For an autoloaded subroutine without a GV, will create a GV even
if C<level < 0>.  For an autoloaded subroutine without a stub, GvCV()
of the result may be zero.

=item gv_stashpvn
X<gv_stashpvn>

Returns a pointer to the stash for a specified package.  The C<namelen>
parameter indicates the length of the C<name>, in bytes.  C<flags> is passed
to C<gv_fetchpvn_flags()>, so if set to C<GV_ADD> then the package will be
created if it does not already exist.  If the package does not exist and
C<flags> is 0 (or any other setting that does not create packages) then NULL
is returned.

necessary dereferencing of possibly C<SV*> keys.  The length of the string
is placed in C<len> (this is a macro, so do I<not> use C<&len>).  If you do
not care about what the length of the key is, you may use the global
variable C<PL_na>, though this is rather less efficient than using a local
variable.  Remember though, that hash keys in perl are free to contain
embedded nulls, so using C<strlen()> or similar is not a good way to find
the length of hash keys. This is very similar to the C<SvPV()> macro

Clears any placeholders from a hash.  If a restricted hash has any of its keys
marked as readonly and the key is subsequently deleted, the key is not actually
deleted but is marked by assigning it a value of &PL_sv_placeholder.  This tags
it so it will be ignored by future operations such as iterating over the hash,
but will still allow the hash to have a value reassigned to the key at some
future point.  This function clears any such placeholder keys from the hash.

will be part of a store.  Make sure the return value is non-null before
accessing it.  The return value when C<tb> is a tied hash is a pointer to a

iterator.  Note that in this case the current entry is deleted from the hash
with your iterator holding the last reference to it.  Your iterator is flagged

Currently a placeholder is implemented with a value that is

=item hv_store
X<hv_store>

Stores an SV in a hash.  The hash key is specified as C<key> and C<klen> is
the length of the key.  The C<hash> parameter is the precomputed hash
value; if it is zero then Perl will compute it.  The return value will be
NULL if the operation failed or if the value did not need to be actually
stored within the hash (as in the case of tied hashes).  Otherwise it can
be dereferenced to get the original C<SV*>.  Note that the caller is
responsible for suitably incrementing the reference count of C<val> before
the call, and decrementing it if the function returned NULL.  Effectively
a successful hv_store takes ownership of one reference to C<val>.  This is
usually what you want; a newly created SV has a reference count of one, so
if all your code does is create SVs then store them in a hash, hv_store
will own the only reference to the new SV, and your code doesn't need to do
anything further to tidy up.  hv_store is not implemented as a call to
hv_store_ent, and does not create a temporary SV for the key, so if your
key data is not already in SV form then use hv_store in preference to
hv_store_ent.

compute it.  The return value is the new hash entry so created.  It will be
NULL if the operation failed or if the value did not need to be actually
stored within the hash (as in the case of tied hashes).  Otherwise the
contents of the return value can be accessed using the C<He?> macros
described here.  Note that the caller is responsible for suitably
incrementing the reference count of C<val> before the call, and
decrementing it if the function returned NULL.  Effectively a successful
hv_store_ent takes ownership of one reference to C<val>.  This is
usually what you want; a newly created SV has a reference count of one, so
if all your code does is create SVs then store them in a hash, hv_store
will own the only reference to the new SV, and your code doesn't need to do
anything further to tidy up.  Note that hv_store_ent only reads the C<key>;
unlike C<val> it does not take ownership of it, so maintaining the correct
reference count on C<key> is entirely the caller's responsibility.  hv_store
is not implemented as a call to hv_store_ent, and does not create a temporary

Perl automatically handles most of the common
ways a method might be redefined.  However, there
are a few ways you could change a method in a stash
without the cache code noticing, in which case you
need to call this method afterwards:

1) Directly manipulating the stash HV entries from
XS code.

2) Assigning a reference to a readonly scalar
constant into a stash entry in order to create
a constant subroutine (like constant.pm

Return a non-zero integer if the sign bit on an NV is set, and 0 if

If Configure detects this system has a signbit() that will work with
our NVs, then we just use it via the #define in perl.h.  Otherwise,
fall back on this implementation.  As a first pass, this gets everything
right except -0.0.  Alas, catching -0.0 is the main use for this function,
so this is not too helpful yet.  Still, at least we have the scaffolding
in place to support other systems, should that prove useful.


Configure notes:  This function is called 'Perl_signbit' instead of a
plain 'signbit' because it is easy to imagine a system having a signbit()
function or macro that doesn't happen to work with our particular choice
of NVs.  We shouldn't just re-#define signbit as Perl_signbit and expect
the standard system headers to be happy.  Also, this is a no-context
function (no pTHX_) because Perl_signbit() is usually re-#defined in
perl.h as a simple macro call to the system's signbit().
Users should just always call Perl_signbit().

C<PL_modglobal> is a general purpose, interpreter global HV for use by
extensions that need to keep information on a per-interpreter basis.
In a pinch, it can also be used as a symbol table for extensions
to share data among each other.  It is a good idea to use keys
prefixed by the package name of the extension that owns the data.

value is used; otherwise the hash is computed. The string's hash can be later
be retrieved from the SV with the C<SvSHARED_HASH()> macro. The idea here is
that as the string table is used for shared hash keys these strings will have
SvPVX_const == HeKEY and hash lookup will avoid string compare.

Undo various types of fakery on an SV: if the PV is a shared string, make
a private copy; if we're a ref, stop refing; if we're a glob, downgrade to
an xpvmg; if we're a copy-on-write scalar, this is the on-write time when
we do the copy, and is also used locally. If C<SV_COW_DROP_PV> is set
then a copy-on-write scalar drops its PV buffer (if any) and becomes
SvPOK_off rather than making a copy. (Used where this scalar is about to be
set to some other value.) In addition, the C<flags> parameter gets passed to
C<sv_unref_flags()> when unrefing. C<sv_force_normal> calls this function
with flags set to 0.

See C<sv_magicext> (which C<sv_magic> now calls) for a description of the
handling of the C<name> and C<namlen> arguments.

In particular, you can add magic to SvREADONLY SVs, and add more than
one instance of the same 'how'.

If C<namlen> is greater than zero then a C<savepvn> I<copy> of C<name> is
stored, if C<namlen> is zero then C<name> is stored as-is and - as another
special case - if C<(name && namlen == HEf_SVKEY)> then C<name> is assumed
to contain an C<SV*> and is stored as-is with its REFCNT incremented.

by C<malloc>.  The string length, C<len>, must be supplied.  By default
this function will realloc (i.e. move) the memory pointed to by C<ptr>,
so that pointer should not be freed or used by the programmer after
giving it to sv_usepvn, and neither should any pointers from "behind"
that pointer (e.g. ptr + 1) be used.

If C<flags> & SV_SMAGIC is true, will call SvSETMAGIC. If C<flags> &
SV_HAS_TRAILING_NUL is true, then C<ptr[len]> must be NUL, and the realloc

Return true if the strings s1 and s2 differ case-insensitively, false

string s1 is assumed to be in UTF-8-encoded Unicode.  If u2 is true,
the string s2 is assumed to be in UTF-8-encoded Unicode.  If u1 or u2
are false, the respective string is assumed to be in native 8-bit
encoding.

If the pe1 and pe2 are non-NULL, the scanning pointers will be copied
in there (they will point at the beginning of the I<next> character).
If the pointers behind pe1 or pe2 are non-NULL, they are the end
pointers beyond which scanning will not continue under any
circumstances.  If the byte lengths l1 and l2 are non-zero, s1+l1 and
s2+l2 will be used as goal end pointers that will also stop the scan,
and which qualify towards defining a successful match: all the scans
that define an explicit length must reach their goal pointers for
a match to succeed).

For case-insensitiveness, the "casefolding" of Unicode is used
instead of upper/lowercasing both the characters, see

    d = uvuni_to_utf8_flags(d, uv, 0);

is the recommended Unicode-aware way of saying

=item ax
X<ax>

Variable which is setup by C<xsubpp> to indicate the stack base offset,
used by the C<ST>, C<XSprePUSH> and C<XSRETURN> macros.  The C<dMARK> macro
must be called prior to setup the C<MARK> variable.

=head1 Warning and Dieing

=over 8

=item croak
X<croak>

This is the XSUB-writer's interface to Perl's C<die> function.
Normally call this function the same way you call the C C<printf>
function.  Calling C<croak> returns control directly to Perl,
sidestepping the normal C order of execution. See C<warn>.

If you want to throw an exception object, assign the object to
C<$@> and then pass C<NULL> to croak():

   errsv = get_sv("@", TRUE);
   sv_setsv(errsv, exception_object);
   croak(NULL);

	void	croak(const char* pat, ...)

=for hackers
Found in file util.c

=item warn
