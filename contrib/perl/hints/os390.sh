yacc parser template file, in place in /etc.

            cat <<EOWARN >&4

There does appear to be a template file in /samples though.
Please run:

      cp /samples/yyparse.c /etc

before attempting to Configure the build of $package.

EOWARN

            cat <<EOWARN >&4

There does not appear to be one in /samples either.  
If you feel you can make use of an alternate yacc-like 
parser generator then please read the comments in the
hints/os390.sh file carefully.
