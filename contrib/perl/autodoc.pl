=head1 NAME

perlapi - autogenerated documentation for the perl public API

=head1 DESCRIPTION
X<Perl API> X<API> X<api>

This file contains the documentation of the perl public API generated by
embed.pl, specifically a listing of functions, macros, flags, and variables
that may be used by extension writers.  L<At the end|/Undocumented functions>
is a list of functions which have yet to be documented.  The interfaces of
those are subject to change without notice.  Any functions not listed here are
not part of the public API, and should not be used by extension writers at
all.  For these reasons, blindly using functions listed in proto.h is to be
avoided when writing extensions.

Note that all Perl API global variables must be referenced with the C<PL_>
prefix.  Some macros are provided for compatibility with the older,
unadorned names, but this support may be disabled in a future release.

Perl was originally written to handle US-ASCII only (that is characters
whose ordinal numbers are in the range 0 - 127).
And documentation and comments may still use the term ASCII, when
sometimes in fact the entire range from 0 - 255 is meant.

Note that Perl can be compiled and run under EBCDIC (See L<perlebcdic>)
or ASCII.  Most of the documentation (and even comments in the code)
ignore the EBCDIC possibility.  
For almost all purposes the differences are transparent.
As an example, under EBCDIC,
instead of UTF-8, UTF-EBCDIC is used to encode Unicode strings, and so
whenever this documentation refers to C<utf8>
(and variants of that name, including in function names),
it also (essentially transparently) means C<UTF-EBCDIC>.
But the ordinals of characters differ between ASCII, EBCDIC, and
the UTF- encodings, and a string encoded in UTF-EBCDIC may occupy more bytes
than in UTF-8.

Also, on some EBCDIC machines, functions that are documented as operating on
US-ASCII (or Basic Latin in Unicode terminology) may in fact operate on all
256 characters in the EBCDIC range, not just the subset corresponding to
US-ASCII.

The listing below is alphabetical, case insensitive.

perlintern - autogenerated documentation of purely B<internal>
		 Perl functions

=head1 DESCRIPTION
X<internal Perl functions> X<interpreter functions>

This file is the autogenerated documentation of functions in the
Perl interpreter that are documented using Perl's internal documentation
format but are not marked as part of the Perl API. In other words,
B<they are not for use in extensions>!

END

=head1 AUTHORS

The autodocumentation system was originally added to the Perl core by
Benjamin Stuhl. Documentation is by whoever was kind enough to
document their functions.
