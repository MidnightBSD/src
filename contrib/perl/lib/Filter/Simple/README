NAME
    Filter::Simple - Simplified source filtering

SYNOPSIS
     # in MyFilter.pm:

	 package MyFilter;

	 use Filter::Simple;
	 
	 FILTER { ... };

	 # or just:
	 #
	 # use Filter::Simple sub { ... };


     # in user's code:

	 use MyFilter;

	 # this is filtered

	 no MyFilter;

	 # this is not


DESCRIPTION
    The Filter::Simple module provides a simplified interface to
    Filter::Util::Call; one that is sufficient for most common cases.
