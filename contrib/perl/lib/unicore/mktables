# mktables -- create the runtime Perl Unicode files (lib/unicore/.../*.pl),
# from the Unicode database files (lib/unicore/.../*.txt),  It also generates
# a pod file and a .t file
#
# The structure of this file is:
#   First these introductory comments; then
#   code needed for everywhere, such as debugging stuff; then
#   code to handle input parameters; then
#   data structures likely to be of external interest (some of which depend on
#       the input parameters, so follows them; then
#   more data structures and subroutine and package (class) definitions; then
#   the small actual loop to process the input files and finish up; then
#   a __DATA__ section, for the .t tests
#
# This program works on all releases of Unicode through at least 6.0.  The
# outputs have been scrutinized most intently for release 5.1.  The others
# have been checked for somewhat more than just sanity.  It can handle all
# existing Unicode character properties in those releases.
#
# This program is mostly about Unicode character (or code point) properties.
# A property describes some attribute or quality of a code point, like if it
# is lowercase or not, its name, what version of Unicode it was first defined
# in, or what its uppercase equivalent is.  Unicode deals with these disparate
# possibilities by making all properties into mappings from each code point
# into some corresponding value.  In the case of it being lowercase or not,
# the mapping is either to 'Y' or 'N' (or various synonyms thereof).  Each
# property maps each Unicode code point to a single value, called a "property
# value".  (Hence each Unicode property is a true mathematical function with
# exactly one value per code point.)
#
# When using a property in a regular expression, what is desired isn't the
# mapping of the code point to its property's value, but the reverse (or the
# mathematical "inverse relation"): starting with the property value, "Does a
# code point map to it?"  These are written in a "compound" form:
# \p{property=value}, e.g., \p{category=punctuation}.  This program generates
# files containing the lists of code points that map to each such regular
# expression property value, one file per list
#
# There is also a single form shortcut that Perl adds for many of the commonly
# used properties.  This happens for all binary properties, plus script,
# general_category, and block properties.
#
# Thus the outputs of this program are files.  There are map files, mostly in
# the 'To' directory; and there are list files for use in regular expression
# matching, all in subdirectories of the 'lib' directory, with each
# subdirectory being named for the property that the lists in it are for.
# Bookkeeping, test, and documentation files are also generated.

my $matches_directory = 'lib';   # Where match (\p{}) files go.
my $map_directory = 'To';        # Where map files go.

# DATA STRUCTURES
#
# The major data structures of this program are Property, of course, but also
# Table.  There are two kinds of tables, very similar to each other.
# "Match_Table" is the data structure giving the list of code points that have
# a particular property value, mentioned above.  There is also a "Map_Table"
# data structure which gives the property's mapping from code point to value.
# There are two structures because the match tables need to be combined in
# various ways, such as constructing unions, intersections, complements, etc.,
# and the map ones don't.  And there would be problems, perhaps subtle, if
# a map table were inadvertently operated on in some of those ways.
# The use of separate classes with operations defined on one but not the other
# prevents accidentally confusing the two.
#
# At the heart of each table's data structure is a "Range_List", which is just
# an ordered list of "Ranges", plus ancillary information, and methods to
# operate on them.  A Range is a compact way to store property information.
# Each range has a starting code point, an ending code point, and a value that
# is meant to apply to all the code points between the two end points,
# inclusive.  For a map table, this value is the property value for those
# code points.  Two such ranges could be written like this:
#   0x41 .. 0x5A, 'Upper',
#   0x61 .. 0x7A, 'Lower'
#
# Each range also has a type used as a convenience to classify the values.
# Most ranges in this program will be Type 0, or normal, but there are some
# ranges that have a non-zero type.  These are used only in map tables, and
# are for mappings that don't fit into the normal scheme of things.  Mappings
# that require a hash entry to communicate with utf8.c are one example;
# another example is mappings for charnames.pm to use which indicate a name
# that is algorithmically determinable from its code point (and vice-versa).
# These are used to significantly compact these tables, instead of listing
# each one of the tens of thousands individually.
#
# In a match table, the value of a range is irrelevant (and hence the type as
# well, which will always be 0), and arbitrarily set to the null string.
# Using the example above, there would be two match tables for those two
# entries, one named Upper would contain the 0x41..0x5A range, and the other
# named Lower would contain 0x61..0x7A.
#
# Actually, there are two types of range lists, "Range_Map" is the one
# associated with map tables, and "Range_List" with match tables.
# Again, this is so that methods can be defined on one and not the other so as
# to prevent operating on them in incorrect ways.
#
# Eventually, most tables are written out to files to be read by utf8_heavy.pl
# in the perl core.  All tables could in theory be written, but some are
# suppressed because there is no current practical use for them.  It is easy
# to change which get written by changing various lists that are near the top
# of the actual code in this file.  The table data structures contain enough
# ancillary information to allow them to be treated as separate entities for
# writing, such as the path to each one's file.  There is a heading in each
# map table that gives the format of its entries, and what the map is for all
# the code points missing from it.  (This allows tables to be more compact.)
#
# The Property data structure contains one or more tables.  All properties
# contain a map table (except the $perl property which is a
# pseudo-property containing only match tables), and any properties that
# are usable in regular expression matches also contain various matching
# tables, one for each value the property can have.  A binary property can
# have two values, True and False (or Y and N, which are preferred by Unicode
# terminology).  Thus each of these properties will have a map table that
# takes every code point and maps it to Y or N (but having ranges cuts the
# number of entries in that table way down), and two match tables, one
# which has a list of all the code points that map to Y, and one for all the
# code points that map to N.  (For each of these, a third table is also
# generated for the pseudo Perl property.  It contains the identical code
# points as the Y table, but can be written, not in the compound form, but in
# a "single" form like \p{IsUppercase}.)  Many properties are binary, but some
# properties have several possible values, some have many, and properties like
# Name have a different value for every named code point.  Those will not,
# unless the controlling lists are changed, have their match tables written
# out.  But all the ones which can be used in regular expression \p{} and \P{}
# constructs will.  Generally a property will have either its map table or its
# match tables written but not both.  Again, what gets written is controlled
# by lists which can easily be changed.  Properties have a 'Type', like
# binary, or string, or enum depending on how many match tables there are and
# the content of the maps.  This 'Type' is different than a range 'Type', so
# don't get confused by the two concepts having the same name.
#
# For information about the Unicode properties, see Unicode's UAX44 document:

my $unicode_reference_url = 'http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr44/';

# As stated earlier, this program will work on any release of Unicode so far.
# Most obvious problems in earlier data have NOT been corrected except when
# necessary to make Perl or this program work reasonably.  For example, no
# folding information was given in early releases, so this program uses the
# substitute of lower case, just so that a regular expression with the /i
# option will do something that actually gives the right results in many
# cases.  There are also a couple other corrections for version 1.1.5,
# commented at the point they are made.  As an example of corrections that
# weren't made (but could be) is this statement from DerivedAge.txt: "The
# supplementary private use code points and the non-character code points were
# assigned in version 2.0, but not specifically listed in the UCD until
# versions 3.0 and 3.1 respectively."  (To be precise it was 3.0.1 not 3.0.0)
# More information on Unicode version glitches is further down in these
# introductory comments.
#
# This program works on all non-provisional properties as of 6.0, though the
# files for some are suppressed from apparent lack of demand for them.  You
# can change which are output by changing lists in this program.
#
# The old version of mktables emphasized the term "Fuzzy" to mean Unicode's
# loose matchings rules (from Unicode TR18):
#
#    The recommended names for UCD properties and property values are in
#    PropertyAliases.txt [Prop] and PropertyValueAliases.txt
#    [PropValue]. There are both abbreviated names and longer, more
#    descriptive names. It is strongly recommended that both names be
#    recognized, and that loose matching of property names be used,
#    whereby the case distinctions, whitespace, hyphens, and underbar
#    are ignored.
# The program still allows Fuzzy to override its determination of if loose
# matching should be used, but it isn't currently used, as it is no longer
# needed; the calculations it makes are good enough.
#
# SUMMARY OF HOW IT WORKS:
#
#   Process arguments
#
#   A list is constructed containing each input file that is to be processed
#
#   Each file on the list is processed in a loop, using the associated handler
#   code for each:
#        The PropertyAliases.txt and PropValueAliases.txt files are processed
#            first.  These files name the properties and property values.
#            Objects are created of all the property and property value names
#            that the rest of the input should expect, including all synonyms.
#        The other input files give mappings from properties to property
#           values.  That is, they list code points and say what the mapping
#           is under the given property.  Some files give the mappings for
#           just one property; and some for many.  This program goes through
#           each file and populates the properties from them.  Some properties
#           are listed in more than one file, and Unicode has set up a
#           precedence as to which has priority if there is a conflict.  Thus
#           the order of processing matters, and this program handles the
#           conflict possibility by processing the overriding input files
#           last, so that if necessary they replace earlier values.
#        After this is all done, the program creates the property mappings not
#            furnished by Unicode, but derivable from what it does give.
#        The tables of code points that match each property value in each
#            property that is accessible by regular expressions are created.
#        The Perl-defined properties are created and populated.  Many of these
#            require data determined from the earlier steps
#        Any Perl-defined synonyms are created, and name clashes between Perl
#            and Unicode are reconciled and warned about.
#        All the properties are written to files
#        Any other files are written, and final warnings issued.
#
# For clarity, a number of operators have been overloaded to work on tables:
#   ~ means invert (take all characters not in the set).  The more
#       conventional '!' is not used because of the possibility of confusing
#       it with the actual boolean operation.
#   + means union
#   - means subtraction
#   & means intersection
# The precedence of these is the order listed.  Parentheses should be
# copiously used.  These are not a general scheme.  The operations aren't
# defined for a number of things, deliberately, to avoid getting into trouble.
# Operations are done on references and affect the underlying structures, so
# that the copy constructors for them have been overloaded to not return a new
# clone, but the input object itself.
#
# The bool operator is deliberately not overloaded to avoid confusion with
# "should it mean if the object merely exists, or also is non-empty?".
#
# WHY CERTAIN DESIGN DECISIONS WERE MADE
#
# This program needs to be able to run under miniperl.  Therefore, it uses a
# minimum of other modules, and hence implements some things itself that could
# be gotten from CPAN
#
# This program uses inputs published by the Unicode Consortium.  These can
# change incompatibly between releases without the Perl maintainers realizing
# it.  Therefore this program is now designed to try to flag these.  It looks
# at the directories where the inputs are, and flags any unrecognized files.
# It keeps track of all the properties in the files it handles, and flags any
# that it doesn't know how to handle.  It also flags any input lines that
# don't match the expected syntax, among other checks.
#
# It is also designed so if a new input file matches one of the known
# templates, one hopefully just needs to add it to a list to have it
# processed.
#
# As mentioned earlier, some properties are given in more than one file.  In
# particular, the files in the extracted directory are supposedly just
# reformattings of the others.  But they contain information not easily
# derivable from the other files, including results for Unihan, which this
# program doesn't ordinarily look at, and for unassigned code points.  They
# also have historically had errors or been incomplete.  In an attempt to
# create the best possible data, this program thus processes them first to
# glean information missing from the other files; then processes those other
# files to override any errors in the extracted ones.  Much of the design was
# driven by this need to store things and then possibly override them.
#
# It tries to keep fatal errors to a minimum, to generate something usable for
# testing purposes.  It always looks for files that could be inputs, and will
# warn about any that it doesn't know how to handle (the -q option suppresses
# the warning).
#
# Why have files written out for binary 'N' matches?
#   For binary properties, if you know the mapping for either Y or N; the
#   other is trivial to construct, so could be done at Perl run-time by just
#   complementing the result, instead of having a file for it.  That is, if
#   someone types in \p{foo: N}, Perl could translate that to \P{foo: Y} and
#   not need a file.   The problem is communicating to Perl that a given
#   property is binary.  Perl can't figure it out from looking at the N (or
#   No), as some non-binary properties have these as property values.  So
#   rather than inventing a way to communicate this info back to the core,
#   which would have required changes there as well, it was simpler just to
#   add the extra tables.
#
# Why is there more than one type of range?
#   This simplified things.  There are some very specialized code points that
#   have to be handled specially for output, such as Hangul syllable names.
#   By creating a range type (done late in the development process), it
#   allowed this to be stored with the range, and overridden by other input.
#   Originally these were stored in another data structure, and it became a
#   mess trying to decide if a second file that was for the same property was
#   overriding the earlier one or not.
#
# Why are there two kinds of tables, match and map?
#   (And there is a base class shared by the two as well.)  As stated above,
#   they actually are for different things.  Development proceeded much more
#   smoothly when I (khw) realized the distinction.  Map tables are used to
#   give the property value for every code point (actually every code point
#   that doesn't map to a default value).  Match tables are used for regular
#   expression matches, and are essentially the inverse mapping.  Separating
#   the two allows more specialized methods, and error checks so that one
#   can't just take the intersection of two map tables, for example, as that
#   is nonsensical.
#
# There are no match tables generated for matches of the null string.  These
# would look like qr/\p{JSN=}/ currently without modifying the regex code.
# Perhaps something like them could be added if necessary.  The JSN does have
# a real code point U+110B that maps to the null string, but it is a
# contributory property, and therefore not output by default.  And it's easily
# handled so far by making the null string the default where it is a
# possibility.
#
# DEBUGGING
#
# This program is written so it will run under miniperl.  Occasionally changes
# will cause an error where the backtrace doesn't work well under miniperl.
# To diagnose the problem, you can instead run it under regular perl, if you
# have one compiled.
#
# There is a good trace facility.  To enable it, first sub DEBUG must be set
# to return true.  Then a line like
#
# local $to_trace = 1 if main::DEBUG;
#
# can be added to enable tracing in its lexical scope or until you insert
# another line:
#
# local $to_trace = 0 if main::DEBUG;
#
# then use a line like "trace $a, @b, %c, ...;
#
# Some of the more complex subroutines already have trace statements in them.
# Permanent trace statements should be like:
#
# trace ... if main::DEBUG && $to_trace;
#
# If there is just one or a few files that you're debugging, you can easily
# cause most everything else to be skipped.  Change the line
#
# my $debug_skip = 0;
#
# to 1, and every file whose object is in @input_file_objects and doesn't have
# a, 'non_skip => 1,' in its constructor will be skipped.
#
# To compare the output tables, it may be useful to specify the -annotate
# flag.  This causes the tables to expand so there is one entry for each
# non-algorithmically named code point giving, currently its name, and its
# graphic representation if printable (and you have a font that knows about
# it).  This makes it easier to see what the particular code points are in
# each output table.  The tables are usable, but because they don't have
# ranges (for the most part), a Perl using them will run slower.  Non-named
# code points are annotated with a description of their status, and contiguous
# ones with the same description will be output as a range rather than
# individually.  Algorithmically named characters are also output as ranges,
# except when there are just a few contiguous ones.
#
# FUTURE ISSUES
#
# The program would break if Unicode were to change its names so that
# interior white space, underscores, or dashes differences were significant
# within property and property value names.
#
# It might be easier to use the xml versions of the UCD if this program ever
# would need heavy revision, and the ability to handle old versions was not
# required.
#
# There is the potential for name collisions, in that Perl has chosen names
# that Unicode could decide it also likes.  There have been such collisions in
# the past, with mostly Perl deciding to adopt the Unicode definition of the
# name.  However in the 5.2 Unicode beta testing, there were a number of such
# collisions, which were withdrawn before the final release, because of Perl's
# and other's protests.  These all involved new properties which began with
# 'Is'.  Based on the protests, Unicode is unlikely to try that again.  Also,
# many of the Perl-defined synonyms, like Any, Word, etc, are listed in a
# Unicode document, so they are unlikely to be used by Unicode for another
# purpose.  However, they might try something beginning with 'In', or use any
# of the other Perl-defined properties.  This program will warn you of name
# collisions, and refuse to generate tables with them, but manual intervention
# will be required in this event.  One scheme that could be implemented, if
# necessary, would be to have this program generate another file, or add a
# field to mktables.lst that gives the date of first definition of a property.
# Each new release of Unicode would use that file as a basis for the next
# iteration.  And the Perl synonym addition code could sort based on the age
# of the property, so older properties get priority, and newer ones that clash
# would be refused; hence existing code would not be impacted, and some other
# synonym would have to be used for the new property.  This is ugly, and
# manual intervention would certainly be easier to do in the short run; lets
# hope it never comes to this.
#
# A NOTE ON UNIHAN
#
# This program can generate tables from the Unihan database.  But it doesn't
# by default, letting the CPAN module Unicode::Unihan handle them.  Prior to
# version 5.2, this database was in a single file, Unihan.txt.  In 5.2 the
# database was split into 8 different files, all beginning with the letters
# 'Unihan'.  This program will read those file(s) if present, but it needs to
# know which of the many properties in the file(s) should have tables created
# for them.  It will create tables for any properties listed in
# PropertyAliases.txt and PropValueAliases.txt, plus any listed in the
# @cjk_properties array and the @cjk_property_values array.  Thus, if a
# property you want is not in those files of the release you are building
# against, you must add it to those two arrays.  Starting in 4.0, the
# Unicode_Radical_Stroke was listed in those files, so if the Unihan database
# is present in the directory, a table will be generated for that property.
# In 5.2, several more properties were added.  For your convenience, the two
# arrays are initialized with all the 6.0 listed properties that are also in
# earlier releases.  But these are commented out.  You can just uncomment the
# ones you want, or use them as a template for adding entries for other
# properties.
#
# You may need to adjust the entries to suit your purposes.  setup_unihan(),
# and filter_unihan_line() are the functions where this is done.  This program
# already does some adjusting to make the lines look more like the rest of the
# Unicode DB;  You can see what that is in filter_unihan_line()
#
# There is a bug in the 3.2 data file in which some values for the
# kPrimaryNumeric property have commas and an unexpected comment.  A filter
# could be added for these; or for a particular installation, the Unihan.txt
# file could be edited to fix them.
#
# HOW TO ADD A FILE TO BE PROCESSED
#
# A new file from Unicode needs to have an object constructed for it in
# @input_file_objects, probably at the end or at the end of the extracted
# ones.  The program should warn you if its name will clash with others on
# restrictive file systems, like DOS.  If so, figure out a better name, and
# add lines to the README.perl file giving that.  If the file is a character
# property, it should be in the format that Unicode has by default
# standardized for such files for the more recently introduced ones.
# If so, the Input_file constructor for @input_file_objects can just be the
# file name and release it first appeared in.  If not, then it should be
# possible to construct an each_line_handler() to massage the line into the
# standardized form.
#
# For non-character properties, more code will be needed.  You can look at
# the existing entries for clues.
#
# UNICODE VERSIONS NOTES
#
# The Unicode UCD has had a number of errors in it over the versions.  And
# these remain, by policy, in the standard for that version.  Therefore it is
# risky to correct them, because code may be expecting the error.  So this
# program doesn't generally make changes, unless the error breaks the Perl
# core.  As an example, some versions of 2.1.x Jamo.txt have the wrong value
# for U+1105, which causes real problems for the algorithms for Jamo
# calculations, so it is changed here.
#
# But it isn't so clear cut as to what to do about concepts that are
# introduced in a later release; should they extend back to earlier releases
# where the concept just didn't exist?  It was easier to do this than to not,
# so that's what was done.  For example, the default value for code points not
# in the files for various properties was probably undefined until changed by
# some version.  No_Block for blocks is such an example.  This program will
# assign No_Block even in Unicode versions that didn't have it.  This has the
# benefit that code being written doesn't have to special case earlier
# versions; and the detriment that it doesn't match the Standard precisely for
# the affected versions.
#
# Here are some observations about some of the issues in early versions:
#
# The number of code points in \p{alpha} halved in 2.1.9.  It turns out that
# the reason is that the CJK block starting at 4E00 was removed from PropList,
# and was not put back in until 3.1.0
#
# Unicode introduced the synonym Space for White_Space in 4.1.  Perl has
# always had a \p{Space}.  In release 3.2 only, they are not synonymous.  The
# reason is that 3.2 introduced U+205F=medium math space, which was not
# classed as white space, but Perl figured out that it should have been. 4.0
# reclassified it correctly.
#
# Another change between 3.2 and 4.0 is the CCC property value ATBL.  In 3.2
# this was erroneously a synonym for 202.  In 4.0, ATB became 202, and ATBL
# was left with no code points, as all the ones that mapped to 202 stayed
# mapped to 202.  Thus if your program used the numeric name for the class,
# it would not have been affected, but if it used the mnemonic, it would have
# been.
#
# \p{Script=Hrkt} (Katakana_Or_Hiragana) came in 4.0.1.  Before that code
# points which eventually came to have this script property value, instead
# mapped to "Unknown".  But in the next release all these code points were
# moved to \p{sc=common} instead.
#
# The default for missing code points for BidiClass is complicated.  Starting
# in 3.1.1, the derived file DBidiClass.txt handles this, but this program
# tries to do the best it can for earlier releases.  It is done in
# process_PropertyAliases()

package Input_file;

# All input files use this object, which stores various attributes about them,
# and provides for convenient, uniform handling.  The run method wraps the
# processing.  It handles all the bookkeeping of opening, reading, and closing
# the file, returning only significant input lines.
#
# Each object gets a handler which processes the body of the file, and is
# called by run().  Most should use the generic, default handler, which has
# code scrubbed to handle things you might not expect.  A handler should
# basically be a while(next_line()) {...} loop.
#
# You can also set up handlers to
#   1) call before the first line is read for pre processing
#   2) call to adjust each line of the input before the main handler gets them
#   3) call upon EOF before the main handler exits its loop
#   4) call at the end for post processing
#
# $_ is used to store the input line, and is to be filtered by the
# each_line_handler()s.  So, if the format of the line is not in the desired
# format for the main handler, these are used to do that adjusting.  They can
# be stacked (by enclosing them in an [ anonymous array ] in the constructor,
# so the $_ output of one is used as the input to the next.  None of the other
# handlers are stackable, but could easily be changed to be so.
#
# Most of the handlers can call insert_lines() or insert_adjusted_lines()
# which insert the parameters as lines to be processed before the next input
# file line is read.  This allows the EOF handler to flush buffers, for
# example.  The difference between the two routines is that the lines inserted
# by insert_lines() are subjected to the each_line_handler()s.  (So if you
# called it from such a handler, you would get infinite recursion.)  Lines
# inserted by insert_adjusted_lines() go directly to the main handler without
# any adjustments.  If the  post-processing handler calls any of these, there
# will be no effect.  Some error checking for these conditions could be added,
# but it hasn't been done.
#
# carp_bad_line() should be called to warn of bad input lines, which clears $_
# to prevent further processing of the line.  This routine will output the
# message as a warning once, and then keep a count of the lines that have the
# same message, and output that count at the end of the file's processing.
# This keeps the number of messages down to a manageable amount.
#
# get_missings() should be called to retrieve any @missing input lines.
# Messages will be raised if this isn't done if the options aren't to ignore
# missings.

# A Map Table is a table that contains the mappings from code points to
# values.  There are two weird cases:
# 1) Anomalous entries are ones that aren't maps of ranges of code points, but
#    are written in the table's file at the end of the table nonetheless.  It
#    requires specially constructed code to handle these; utf8.c can not read
#    these in, so they should not go in $map_directory.  As of this writing,
#    the only case that these happen is for named sequences used in
#    charnames.pm.   But this code doesn't enforce any syntax on these, so
#    something else could come along that uses it.
# 2) Specials are anything that doesn't fit syntactically into the body of the
#    table.  The ranges for these have a map type of non-zero.  The code below
#    knows about and handles each possible type.   In most cases, these are
#    written as part of the header.
#
# A map table deliberately can't be manipulated at will unlike match tables.
# This is because of the ambiguities having to do with what to do with
# overlapping code points.  And there just isn't a need for those things;
# what one wants to do is just query, add, replace, or delete mappings, plus
# write the final result.
# However, there is a method to get the list of possible ranges that aren't in
# this table to use for defaulting missing code point mappings.  And,
# map_add_or_replace_non_nulls() does allow one to add another table to this
# one, but it is clearly very specialized, and defined that the other's
# non-null values replace this one's if there is any overlap.

use base '_Base_Table';

# A Match table is one which is a list of all the code points that have
# the same property and property value, for use in \p{property=value}
# constructs in regular expressions.  It adds very little data to the base
# structure, but many methods, as these lists can be combined in many ways to
# form new ones.
# There are only a few concepts added:
# 1) Equivalents and Relatedness.
#    Two tables can match the identical code points, but have different names.
#    This always happens when there is a perl single form extension
#    \p{IsProperty} for the Unicode compound form \P{Property=True}.  The two
#    tables are set to be related, with the Perl extension being a child, and
#    the Unicode property being the parent.
#
#    It may be that two tables match the identical code points and we don't
#    know if they are related or not.  This happens most frequently when the
#    Block and Script properties have the exact range.  But note that a
#    revision to Unicode could add new code points to the script, which would
#    now have to be in a different block (as the block was filled, or there
#    would have been 'Unknown' script code points in it and they wouldn't have
#    been identical).  So we can't rely on any two properties from Unicode
#    always matching the same code points from release to release, and thus
#    these tables are considered coincidentally equivalent--not related.  When
#    two tables are unrelated but equivalent, one is arbitrarily chosen as the
#    'leader', and the others are 'equivalents'.  This concept is useful
#    to minimize the number of tables written out.  Only one file is used for
#    any identical set of code points, with entries in Heavy.pl mapping all
#    the involved tables to it.
#
#    Related tables will always be identical; we set them up to be so.  Thus
#    if the Unicode one is deprecated, the Perl one will be too.  Not so for
#    unrelated tables.  Relatedness makes generating the documentation easier.
#
# 2) Conflicting.  It may be that there will eventually be name clashes, with
#    the same name meaning different things.  For a while, there actually were
#    conflicts, but they have so far been resolved by changing Perl's or
#    Unicode's definitions to match the other, but when this code was written,
#    it wasn't clear that that was what was going to happen.  (Unicode changed
#    because of protests during their beta period.)  Name clashes are warned
#    about during compilation, and the documentation.  The generated tables
#    are sane, free of name clashes, because the code suppresses the Perl
#    version.  But manual intervention to decide what the actual behavior
#    should be may be required should this happen.  The introductory comments
#    have more to say about this.

package Property;

# The Property class represents a Unicode property, or the $perl
# pseudo-property.  It contains a map table initialized empty at construction
# time, and for properties accessible through regular expressions, various
# match tables, created through the add_match_table() method, and referenced
# by the table('NAME') or tables() methods, the latter returning a list of all
# of the match tables.  Otherwise table operations implicitly are for the map
# table.
#
# Most of the data in the property is actually about its map table, so it
# mostly just uses that table's accessors for most methods.  The two could
# have been combined into one object, but for clarity because of their
# differing semantics, they have been kept separate.  It could be argued that
# the 'file' and 'directory' fields should be kept with the map table.
#
# Each property has a type.  This can be set in the constructor, or in the
# set_type accessor, but mostly it is figured out by the data.  Every property
# starts with unknown type, overridden by a parameter to the constructor, or
# as match tables are added, or ranges added to the map table, the data is
# inspected, and the type changed.  After the table is mostly or entirely
# filled, compute_type() should be called to finalize they analysis.
#
# There are very few operations defined.  One can safely remove a range from
# the map table, and property_add_or_replace_non_nulls() adds the maps from another
# table to this one, replacing any in the intersection of the two.

    # Some of these need a little more explanation:
    # The $PERL_DECIMAL_DIGIT field does not lead to an official Unicode
    #   property, but is used in calculating the Numeric_Type.  Perl however,
    #   creates a file from this field, so a Perl property is created from it.
    # Similarly, the Other_Digit field is used only for calculating the
    #   Numeric_Type, and so it can be safely re-used as the place to store
    #   the value for Numeric_Type; hence it is referred to as
    #   $NUMERIC_TYPE_OTHER_DIGIT.
    # The input field named $PERL_DECOMPOSITION is a combination of both the
    #   decomposition mapping and its type.  Perl creates a file containing
    #   exactly this field, so it is used for that.  The two properties are
    #   separated into two extra output fields, $DECOMP_MAP and $DECOMP_TYPE.
    #   $DECOMP_MAP is usually suppressed (unless the lists are changed to
    #   output it), as Perl doesn't use it directly.
    # The input field named here $CHARNAME is used to construct the
    #   Perl_Charnames property, which is a combination of the Name property
    #   (which the input field contains), and the Unicode_1_Name property, and
    #   others from other files.  Since, the strict Name property is not used
    #   by Perl, this field is used for the table that Perl does use.  The
    #   strict Name property table is usually suppressed (unless the lists are
    #   changed to output it), so it is accumulated in a separate field,
    #   $NAME, which to save time is discarded unless the table is actually to
    #   be output

    # This file is processed like most in this program.  Control is passed to
    # process_generic_property_file() which calls filter_UnicodeData_line()
    # for each input line.  This filter converts the input into line(s) that
    # process_generic_property_file() understands.  There is also a setup
    # routine called before any of the file is processed, and a handler for
    # EOF processing, all in this closure.

    # A huge speed-up occurred at the cost of some added complexity when these
    # routines were altered to buffer the outputs into ranges.  Almost all the
    # lines of the input file apply to just one code point, and for most
    # properties, the map for the next code point up is the same as the
    # current one.  So instead of creating a line for each property for each
    # input line, filter_UnicodeData_line() remembers what the previous map
    # of a property was, and doesn't generate a line to pass on until it has
    # to, as when the map changes; and that passed-on line encompasses the
    # whole contiguous range of code points that have the same map for that
    # property.  This means a slight amount of extra setup, and having to
    # flush these buffers on EOF, testing if the maps have changed, plus
    # remembering state information in the closure.  But it means a lot less
    # real time in not having to change the data base for each property on
    # each line.

    # Another complication is that there are already a few ranges designated
    # in the input.  There are two lines for each, with the same maps except
    # the code point and name on each line.  This was actually the hardest
    # thing to design around.  The code points in those ranges may actually
    # have real maps not given by these two lines.  These maps will either
    # be algorithmically determinable, or in the extracted files furnished
    # with the UCD.  In the event of conflicts between these extracted files,
    # and this one, Unicode says that this one prevails.  But it shouldn't
    # prevail for conflicts that occur in these ranges.  The data from the
    # extracted files prevails in those cases.  So, this program is structured
    # so that those files are processed first, storing maps.  Then the other
    # files are processed, generally overwriting what the extracted files
    # stored.  But just the range lines in this input file are processed
    # without overwriting.  This is accomplished by adding a special string to
    # the lines output to tell process_generic_property_file() to turn off the
    # overwriting for just this one line.
    # A similar mechanism is used to tell it that the map is of a non-default
    # type.

This mapping is a combination of the Unicode 'Decomposition_Type' and

identical to the official Unicode 'Decomposition_Mapping'  property except for
two things:
 1) It omits the algorithmically determinable Hangul syllable decompositions,
which normalize.pm handles algorithmically.
 2) It contains the decomposition type as well.  Non-canonical decompositions
begin with a word in angle brackets, like <super>, which denotes the
compatible decomposition type.  If the map does not begin with the <angle

Matches in the Block property have shortcuts that begin with 'In_'.  For
example, \\p{Block=Latin1} can be written as \\p{In_Latin1}.  For backward
compatibility, if there is no conflict with another shortcut, these may also
be written as \\p{Latin1} or \\p{Is_Latin1}.  But, N.B., there are numerous
such conflicting shortcuts.  Use of these forms for Block is discouraged, and
are flagged as such, not only because of the potential confusion as to what is
meant, but also because a later release of Unicode may preempt the shortcut,
and your program would no longer be correct.  Use the 'In_' form instead to
avoid this, or even more clearly, use the compound form, e.g.,
\\p{blk:latin1}.  See L<perlunicode/"Blocks"> for more information about this.

=head1 NAME

$pod_file - Index of Unicode Version $string_version properties in Perl

=head1 DESCRIPTION

There are many properties in Unicode, and Perl provides access to almost all of
them, as well as some additional extensions and short-cut synonyms.

And just about all of the few that aren't accessible through the Perl
core are accessible through the modules: Unicode::Normalize and
Unicode::UCD, and for Unihan properties, via the CPAN module Unicode::Unihan.

This document merely lists all available properties and does not attempt to
explain what each property really means.  There is a brief description of each
Perl extension.  There is some detail about Blocks, Scripts, General_Category,
and Bidi_Class in L<perlunicode>, but to find out about the intricacies of the
Unicode properties, refer to the Unicode standard.  A good starting place is
L<$unicode_reference_url>.  More information on the Perl extensions is in
L<perlunicode/Other Properties>.

Note that you can define your own properties; see
L<perlunicode/"User-Defined Character Properties">.

=head1 Properties accessible through \\p{} and \\P{}

The Perl regular expression \\p{} and \\P{} constructs give access to most of
the Unicode character properties.  The table below shows all these constructs,
both single and compound forms.

B<Compound forms> consist of two components, separated by an equals sign or a
colon.  The first component is the property name, and the second component is
the particular value of the property to match against, for example,
'\\p{Script: Greek}' and '\\p{Script=Greek}' both mean to match characters
whose Script property is Greek.

B<Single forms>, like '\\p{Greek}', are mostly Perl-defined shortcuts for
their equivalent compound forms.  The table shows these equivalences.  (In our
example, '\\p{Greek}' is a just a shortcut for '\\p{Script=Greek}'.)
There are also a few Perl-defined single forms that are not shortcuts for a
compound form.  One such is \\p{Word}.  These are also listed in the table.

In parsing these constructs, Perl always ignores Upper/lower case differences
everywhere within the {braces}.  Thus '\\p{Greek}' means the same thing as
'\\p{greek}'.  But note that changing the case of the 'p' or 'P' before the
left brace completely changes the meaning of the construct, from "match" (for
'\\p{}') to "doesn't match" (for '\\P{}').  Casing in this document is for
improved legibility.

Also, white space, hyphens, and underscores are also normally ignored
everywhere between the {braces}, and hence can be freely added or removed
even if the C</x> modifier hasn't been specified on the regular expression.
But $a_bold_stricter at the beginning of an entry in the table below
means that tighter (stricter) rules are used for that entry:

=over 4

=item Single form (\\p{name}) tighter rules:

White space, hyphens, and underscores ARE significant
except for:

=over 4

=item * white space adjacent to a non-word character

=item * underscores separating digits in numbers

=back

That means, for example, that you can freely add or remove white space
adjacent to (but within) the braces without affecting the meaning.

=item Compound form (\\p{name=value} or \\p{name:value}) tighter rules:

The tighter rules given above for the single form apply to everything to the
right of the colon or equals; the looser rules still apply to everything to
the left.

That means, for example, that you can freely add or remove white space
adjacent to (but within) the braces and the colon or equal sign.

=back

Some properties are considered obsolete by Unicode, but still available.
There are several varieties of obsolescence:

=over 4

=item Obsolete

Properties marked with $a_bold_obsolete in the table are considered
obsolete.

=item Stabilized

Obsolete properties may be stabilized.  Such a determination does not indicate
that the property should or should not be used; instead it is a declaration
that the property will not be maintained nor extended for newly encoded
characters.  Such properties are marked with $a_bold_stabilized in the
table.

=item Deprecated

An obsolete property may be deprecated, perhaps because its original intent
has been replaced by another property, or because its specification was
somehow defective.  This means that its use is strongly
discouraged, so much so that a warning will be issued if used, unless the
regular expression is in the scope of a C<S<no warnings 'deprecated'>>
statement.  $A_bold_deprecated flags each such entry in the table, and
the entry there for the longest, most descriptive version of the property will
give the reason it is deprecated, and perhaps advice.  Perl may issue such a
warning, even for properties that aren't officially deprecated by Unicode,
when there used to be characters or code points that were matched by them, but
no longer.  This is to warn you that your program may not work like it did on
earlier Unicode releases.

A deprecated property may be made unavailable in a future Perl version, so it
is best to move away from them.

=back

Some Perl extensions are present for backwards compatibility and are
discouraged from being used, but not obsolete.  $A_bold_discouraged
flags each such entry in the table.

@block_warning

The table below has two columns.  The left column contains the \\p{}
constructs to look up, possibly preceded by the flags mentioned above; and
the right column contains information about them, like a description, or
synonyms.  It shows both the single and compound forms for each property that
has them.  If the left column is a short name for a property, the right column
will give its longer, more descriptive name; and if the left column is the
longest name, the right column will show any equivalent shortest name, in both
single and compound forms if applicable.

The right column will also caution you if a property means something different
than what might normally be expected.

All single forms are Perl extensions; a few compound forms are as well, and
are noted as such.

Numbers in (parentheses) indicate the total number of code points matched by
the property.  For emphasis, those properties that match no code points at all
are listed as well in a separate section following the table.

Most properties match the same code points regardless of whether C<"/i">
case-insensitive matching is specified or not.  But a few properties are
affected.  These are shown with the notation

 (/i= other_property)

in the second column.  Under case-insensitive matching they match the
same code pode points as the property "other_property".

There is no description given for most non-Perl defined properties (See
$unicode_reference_url for that).

For compactness, 'B<*>' is used as a wildcard instead of showing all possible
combinations.  For example, entries like:

 \\p{Gc: *}                                  \\p{General_Category: *}

mean that 'Gc' is a synonym for 'General_Category', and anything that is valid
for the latter is also valid for the former.  Similarly,

 \\p{Is_*}                                   \\p{*}

means that if and only if, for example, \\p{Foo} exists, then \\p{Is_Foo} and
\\p{IsFoo} are also valid and all mean the same thing.  And similarly,
\\p{Foo=Bar} means the same as \\p{Is_Foo=Bar} and \\p{IsFoo=Bar}.  '*' here
is restricted to something not beginning with an underscore.

Also, in binary properties, 'Yes', 'T', and 'True' are all synonyms for 'Y'.
And 'No', 'F', and 'False' are all synonyms for 'N'.  The table shows 'Y*' and
'N*' to indicate this, and doesn't have separate entries for the other
possibilities.  Note that not all properties which have values 'Yes' and 'No'
are binary, and they have all their values spelled out without using this wild
card, and a C<NOT> clause in their description that highlights their not being
binary.  These also require the compound form to match them, whereas true
binary properties have both single and compound forms available.

Note that all non-essential underscores are removed in the display of the
short names below.

B<Summary legend:>

=over 4

=item B<*> is a wild-card

=item B<(\\d+)> in the info column gives the number of code points matched by
this property.

=item B<$DEPRECATED> means this is deprecated.

=item B<$OBSOLETE> means this is obsolete.

=item B<$STABILIZED> means this is stabilized.

=item B<$STRICTER> means tighter (stricter) name matching applies.

=item B<$DISCOURAGED> means use of this form is discouraged.

=head1 Properties not accessible through \\p{} and \\P{}

A few properties are accessible in Perl via various function calls only.
These are:

 Lowercase_Mapping          lc() and lcfirst()
 Titlecase_Mapping          ucfirst()
 Uppercase_Mapping          uc()

Case_Folding is accessible through the /i modifier in regular expressions.

The Name property is accessible through the \\N{} interpolation in
double-quoted strings and regular expressions, but both usages require a C<use
charnames;> to be specified, which also contains related functions viacode(),
vianame(), and string_vianame().

=head1 Unicode regular expression properties that are NOT accepted by Perl

Perl will generate an error for a few character properties in Unicode when
used in a regular expression.  The non-Unihan ones are listed below, with the
reasons they are not accepted, perhaps with work-arounds.  The short names for
the properties are listed enclosed in (parentheses).

=over 4

@bad_re_properties

=back

An installation can choose to allow any of these to be matched by downloading
the Unicode database from L<http://www.unicode.org/Public/> to
C<\$Config{privlib}>/F<unicore/> in the Perl source tree, changing the
controlling lists contained in the program
C<\$Config{privlib}>/F<unicore/mktables> and then re-compiling and installing.
(C<\%Config> is available from the Config module).

=head1 Files in the I<To> directory (for serious hackers only)

All Unicode properties are really mappings (in the mathematical sense) from
code points to their respective values.  As part of its build process,
Perl constructs tables containing these mappings for all properties that it
deals with.  Some, but not all, of these are written out into files.
Those written out are in the directory C<\$Config{privlib}>/F<unicore/To/>
(%Config is available from the Config module).

Perl reserves the right to change the format and even the existence of any of
those files without notice, except the ones that were in existence prior to
release 5.13.  If those change, a deprecation cycle will be done first.  These
are:

@map_tables_actually_output

Each of the files in this directory defines two hash entries to help reading
programs decipher it.  One of them looks like this:

    \$utf8::SwashInfo{'ToNAME'}{'format'} = 's';

where 'NAME' is a name to indicate the property.  For backwards compatibility,
this is not necessarily the property's official Unicode name.  (The 'To' is
also for backwards compatibility.)  The hash entry gives the format of the
mapping fields of the table, currently one of the following:

@map_table_formats

This format applies only to the entries in the main body of the table.
Entries defined in hashes or ones that are missing from the list can have a
different format.

The value that the missing entries have is given by the other SwashInfo hash
entry line; it looks like this:

    \$utf8::SwashInfo{'ToNAME'}{'missing'} = 'NaN';

This example line says that any Unicode code points not explicitly listed in
the file have the value 'NaN' under the property indicated by NAME.  If the
value is the special string C<< <code point> >>, it means that the value for
any missing code point is the code point itself.  This happens, for example,
in the file for Uppercase_Mapping (To/Upper.pl), in which code points like the
character 'A', are missing because the uppercase of 'A' is itself.
