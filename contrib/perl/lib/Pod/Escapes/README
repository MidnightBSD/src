NAME
    Pod::Escapes -- for resolving Pod E<...> sequences

SYNOPSIS
      use Pod::Escapes qw(e2char);
      ...la la la, parsing POD, la la la...
      $text = e2char($e_node->label);
      unless(defined $text) {
        print "Unknown E sequence \"", $e_node->label, "\"!";
      }
      ...else print/interpolate $text...

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides things that are useful in decoding Pod E<...>
    sequences. Presumably, it should be used only by Pod parsers and/or
    formatters.

    By default, Pod::Escapes exports none of its symbols. But you can request
    any of them to be exported. Either request them individually, as with `use
    Pod::Escapes qw(symbolname symbolname2...);', or you can do `use
    Pod::Escapes qw(:ALL);' to get all exportable symbols.

[...]

CAVEATS
    On Perl versions before 5.7, Unicode characters with a value over 255 (like
    lambda or emdash) can't be conveyed. This module does work under such early
    Perl versions, but in the place of each such character, you get a "?".
    Latin-1 characters (characters 160-255) are unaffected.

SEE ALSO
    perlpod

    perlpodspec

    Text::Unidecode

PREREQUISITES

This suite requires Perl 5; I've only used it under Perl 5.004, so for
anything lower, you're on your own.

Pod::Escapes doesn't use any nonstandard modules.


INSTALLATION

You install Pod::Escapes, as you would install any perl module
library, by running these commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

If you want to install a private copy of Pod::Escapes in your home
directory, then you should try to produce the initial Makefile with
something like this command:

  perl Makefile.PL LIB=~/perl


DOCUMENTATION

POD-format documentation is included in Escapes.pm.  POD is readable
with the 'perldoc' utility.  See ChangeLog for recent changes.


MACPERL INSTALLATION NOTES

Don't bother with the makefiles.  Just make a Pod directory in your
MacPerl site_lib or lib directory, and move Escapes.pm into there.


SUPPORT

Questions, bug reports, useful code bits, and suggestions for
Pod::Escapes should just be sent to me at sburke@cpan.org
