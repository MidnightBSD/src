	* Release 1.04 -- adding support for E<x123> as an alternate form
	for E<0x123>.  Adding the function e2charnum nad the hash
	%Name2character_number.

	Tests rearranged, and new ones added.	

2002-08-27  Sean M. Burke  sburke@cpan.org

	* Release 1.03 -- previous version mistakenly thought that "x4f"
	was the syntax for hex escapes in Pod.  Perlpod says it's 0x4f, so
	Pod::Escapes has been changed to support this syntax instead
	(instead!).
