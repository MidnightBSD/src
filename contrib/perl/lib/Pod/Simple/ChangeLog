# ChangeLog for Pod::Simple dist
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

2008-06-04   Allison Randal <allison@perl.org>
	* Release 3.07

	Fix module dependencies, make HTML::Entities optional and require
	Test::More.

2008-06-03   Allison Randal <allison@perl.org>
	* Release 3.06

	Fix bugs related to passing $1 to File::Spec, reported by Andrew Hamlin and
	John McNamara.

	Applied a suggested fix from Kevin Ryde to return a successful exit
	code when Pod::Simple::HTML is run from the command line.

	Fix handling of complex L<URL> entries, thanks to tests supplied in RT#4896.

	Fix incorrect handling of S<> entries made up of entirely whitespace, thanks
	to test case from Andreas Koenig.

	Launch Pod::Simple::XHTML, an XHTML compliant, more easily extensible
	HTML formatter.

	Add feature to parse additional text after =begin target as a block
	title, requested by Adam Kennedy.

	Thanks to Hans Dieter Pearcey for applying patches, resolving bugs,
	and generally getting ready for the release.

2007-03-03   Allison Randal <allison@perl.org>
	* Release 3.05

	Standardized all test files on 8.3 naming scheme for Perl core.

	Applied test patches from Jerry Hedden for Perl core when

	Applied test patch from Ken Williams for 5.005_04 compatibility.

	Applied a patch from Christopher Madsen to fix architecture
	directory searches on Gentoo.

	Fixed a failing search test on Debian-based distributions caused
	by Debian stripping Pod documentation out of core modules.
	(Three cheers to the CPAN testers and James Ponza for sending
	enough reports that I could work out the pattern.)

2006-01-18   Allison Randal <allison@perl.org>
	* Release 3.04

	Applied test patches for Perl core integration from Steve Peters.

	Added a 'reinit' method to Pod::Simple::BlackBox for Russ Allbery
	so Pod::Man can provide backward compatibility to existing users
	(such as Module::Build and ExtUtils::MakeMaker).

	Applied patch for extracting case-preserved package names on VMS
	from Craig Berry.

2005-11-21   Allison Randal <allison@perl.org>
	* Release 3.03

	Applied whitespace patches for Pod::Man and Pod::Text from 
	Russ Allbery.

	Applied validation patches to Pod::Simple::HTML from Graham Barr.

2004-05-24   Sean M. Burke <sburke@cpan.org>
	* Release 3.02

	Just fixing some typos in the CSS generated by Pod::Simple:HTMLBatch.

	
2004-05-24   Sean M. Burke <sburke@cpan.org>
	* Release 3.01

	No big changes to the main modules, but there's many changes to
	the important Pod::Simple::HTML module.

	Also, new modules:
	  Pod::Simple::HTMLBatch
	  Pod::Simple::HTMLLegacy
	  Pod::Simple::Progress
	  Pod::Simple::Search
	and tests for these (well, most).

	Some prettying up of the Makefile.PL.

	The test 00about.t is a bit more careful and verbose now.

	The docs are still incomplete, esp. for Pod::Simple::HTML and
	Pod::Simple::HTMLBatch, which I hope to improve quite soon.
	
	
	
2004-05-07   Sean M. Burke <sburke@cpan.org>
	* Release 2.06

	Allison Randal brilliantly refactors a huge monolithic sub in
	Blackbox.pm.  Code is now actually sanely readable!

	I add the new option-attributes fullstop_space_harden and
	codes_in_verbatim, and the two methods abandon_output_string and
        abandon_output_fh.  Not yet documented.

	New test fullstop_spaces.t and new corpus document
	greek_iso_8859_7.pod.
	
	Another version should be forthcoming in a few days that has the
	new Pod::Simple::HTML stuff in it.

	Note to self: document =extend and =encoding in perlpodspec ASAP!

	
2003-11-04  Sean M. Burke <sburke@cpan.org>
	* Release 2.05 -- bugfix version

	In an attempt to stop Perl 5.6 versions from going completely
	crazy, I've tried to basically turn off all Unicode/utf8 support
	under 5.6. Under 5.8 and above, Unicode should work fine, and
	under 5.6, all Unicode characters should be replaced with a little
	"can't render" symbol, either a "¤" or a "?".
	Many many thanks to Jarkko Hietaniemi for helping out.

	(Works under 5.005 now too?)
	
2003-10-10  Sean M. Burke <sburke@cpan.org>
	* Release 2.04 -- minor bugfix version

	* Added some code to insulate Pod::Simple to runtime changes in
	the value of $/.  Thanks to Iain Truskett for catching this.
	* Added FILENO method to TiedOutFH.pm, to work quietly under some
	perls.  Thanks to Jochen Stenzel for catching this.
	* Fixed some tests that erroneously failed under some 5.6's
	because of chdir()s in *.t files messing up @INC  Thanks to many
	who caught this, including Rocco Caputo.
	
2003-09-07  Sean M. Burke <sburke@cpan.org>
	* Release 2.03 -- minor upgrade
	* A =head[1234] command now closes any currently open =over, and
	warns.
	* Fixing a few obscure bugs, including one to do with the
	Makefile.
	* Added some tests for those bugs.
	
2003-09-02  Sean M. Burke <sburke@cpan.org>
	* Release 2.02 -- fixing a testing bug
	* Autrijus Tang found a silly bug of mine in corpustest.t's
	testing of corpus/t/nonesuch.txt.  Fixed,
	* I add encoding_nonesuch.t to test corpus/t/nonesuch.txt better.

	
2003-09-01  Sean M. Burke <sburke@cpan.org>
	* Release 2.01
	* Moved all version numbers up to 2.01 for reasons of Tibetan
	numerology.

	* Implemented =encoding.  Thanks a million to Jarkko, Autrijus,
	Dan Kogai, and many others for their help, patience, and
	encouragement.

	It's not yet documented, but see ./t/corpus/*.txt for examples at
	least.

	* Added 'use utf8' to all the modules.  Byebye perl-5.005
	compatibility, hello decent perl-5.6 compatibility.

2003-09-01  Sean M. Burke <sburke@cpan.org>
	* Release 0.98
	* At Michael Schwern's suggestion, a list that begins with a
	"=item [number]" line where number isn't a 1, is no longer
	treated as an error, but instead is silently coerced into being a
	text-item list, just as if it were "=item wubble" or whatever.
	
2003-08-12  Sean M. Burke <sburke@cpan.org>
	* Release 0.97
	* Loooking goooooood.  Not smelling so much like beta anymore!
	* I think this might be the last version before I go
	putting "use utf8" all over the place.

	* Added placefolders for "=encoding" support.  If you use
	"=encoding", you'll get an error about "not yet implemented"
	instead of "unknown directive".

	* Rewrote Pod::Simple::Pullparser's get_title, and added
	get_version, get_author, and get_description.  Documented them.
	Thanks to Graham Barr for contributing an initial get_title and
	then being patient while I seemed to do nothing with it for months
	on end!
	
	* More tests.
	
	Otherwise just minor changes since last version:
	* Fixed error in Pod::Simple::RTF.
	* Added new but undocumented methods to Pod::Simple:
           unaccept_directive(s) unaccept_target(s) unaccept_code(s)
	* Corrected '=back without =open' error to '=back without =over'
	* A little tweaking to the _verbatim_format code.
	* Dump routines may use \x{NN} instead of \xNN format.
	* Pod::Simple::HTML now uses VerbatimFormatted
	* A few changes ot DEBUG messages -- nothing you'd normally see.

	* Release 0.96
	* Still kinda sorta beta.

	* Much much more docs in this version.  Only a few feature
	changes:

	* Added any_errata_seen to Pod::Simple.  Should've been in there
	ages ago.  Oops!
	* Fixed some errors in the experimental VerbatimFormatted code.
	* Added is_tagname / is_tag to Pod::Simple::PullParserStartToken
	and Pod::Simple::PullParserEndToken
	* Added RTFDEFLANG stuff to Pod::Simple::RTF.

	doing something with X<...>'s.
