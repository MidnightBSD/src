README.macos - Perl under Mac OS (Classic)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This document briefly describes perl under Mac OS (Classic).
If you are running perl under Mac OS X, you don't want to be
here (unless you are in the Classic environment under early versions of
Mac OS X).

When we say "Mac OS" below, we mean Mac OS 7, 8, and 9, and I<not>
Mac OS X.


=head1 DESCRIPTION

The port of Perl to to Mac OS was officially removed as of Perl 5.12,
though the last official production release of MacPerl corresponded to 
Perl 5.6. While Perl 5.10 included the port to Mac OS, ExtUtils::MakeMaker,
a core part of Perl's module installation infrastructure officially dropped support for Mac OS in April 2004.

Historical information (and working binaries of the last released version)
are available from L<http://dev.macperl.org> as of October 2009.

=head1 AUTHOR

E<lt>neeracher@mac.comE<gt>. Chris Nandor E<lt>pudge@pobox.comE<gt>
continued development and maintenance for the duration of the port's life.
