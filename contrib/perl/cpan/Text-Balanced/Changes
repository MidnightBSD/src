Revision history for Perl extension Text-Balanced.

2.02   Thu 20 Jul 2009
	- Fixed the mixed "Damian Conway <adamk@cpan.org>" AUTHOR setting.
	  For the record, I am NOT the author, I'm just the maintainer.
	  Unfortunately, Makefile.PL does not have a MAINTAINER setting and
	  this way all the emails about this module come to me.

2.01   Tue 28 Jul 2009
	- Taken over by Adam Kennedy to move it to a long-term maintenance mode
	- Removing use warnings to restore 5.005 compatibility
	- Removing Module::Build for higher back-compatibility
	- Removing version.pm for higher back-compatibility
	- use Exporter -> use Exporter () to avoid some pathalogical cases
	- Upgraded the bundled author tests to be friendlier
	- Changes order now a more normal reverse chronological

1.95   Mon Apr 28 00:22:04 2003

1.87   Thu Nov 15 21:25:35 2001
	- Made extract_multiple aware of skipped prefixes returned
	  by subroutine extractors (such as extract_quotelike, etc.)
	- Made extract_variable aware of punctuation variables
	- Corified tests

1.86   Mon Sep  3 06:57:08 2001

	- Consolidated POD in .pm file
	- renamed tests to let DOS cope with them

1.85   Sun Jun  3 07:47:18 2001

	  start with an underscore (thanks Jeff)

	- Fixed (HT|X)ML tag extraction in extract_tagged (thanks, Tim)
	- Added explanatory note about prefix matching (thanks again, Tim)
	- Added handling of globs and sub refs to extract_variable
	- Pod tweak (thanks Abigail)
	- Allowed right tags to be run-time evaluated, so
	  extract_tagged($text, '/([a-z]+)', '/end$1') works
	  as expected.
	- Added optional blessing of matches via extract_multiple
	- Fixed bug in autogeneration of closing tags in extract_tagged
	  (Thanks, Coke)
	- Fixed bug in interaction between extract_multiple and
	  gen_extract_tagged (Thanks Anthony)

1.77   Mon Nov 22 06:08:23 1999
	- Fixed major bug in extract_codeblock (would not
	  terminate if there was trailing whitespace)
	- Improved /.../ pattern parsing within codeblocks

1.76   Fri Nov 19 06:51:54 1999
	- IMPORTANT: Now requires 5.005 or better.
	- IMPORTANT: Made extract methods sensitive to the pos()
	  value of the text they are parsing. In other words,
	  all extract subroutines now act like patterns of the form
	  /\G.../gc. See documentation for details.
	- IMPORTANT: Changed semantics of extract_multiple, in line
	  with the above change, and to simplify the semantics to
	  something vaguely predictable. See documentation for details.
	- Added ability to use qr/../'s and raw strings as extractors
	  in extract_multiple. See documentation.
	- Added fourth argument to extract_codeblock to allow
	  outermost brackets to be separately specified. See
	  documentation for details.
	- Reimplemented internals of all extraction subroutines
	  for significant speed-ups (between 100% and 2000%
	  improvement).
	- Fixed nasty bug in extract_variable and extract_codeblock
	  (they were returning prefix as well in scalar context)
	- Allowed read-only strings to be used as arguments in
	  scalar contexts.
	- Renamed delimited_pat to gen-delimited pat (in line with
	  gen_extract_tagged). Old name still works, but is now deprecated.
	- Tweaked all extraction subs so they correctly handle
	  zero-length prefix matches after another zero-length match.

1.66   Fri Jul  2 13:29:22 1999
	- Added ability to use quotelike operators in extract_bracketed
	- Fixed bug under 5.003 ('foreach my $func' not understood)
	- Added escape specification as fourth arg to &extract_delimited
	- Fixed handling of &delimited_pat and &extract_delimited
	  when delimiter is same as escape
	- Fixed handling of ->, =>, and >> in &extract_code
	  when delimiters are "<>"

1.52   Thu Mar  4 12:43:38 1999
	- Added CSV parsing example to documentation of extract_multiple.
	- Fixed a bug with extract_codeblock in "RecDescent" mode
	  (it would accept "subrule(s?)" and "subrule(?)", but
	   not "subrule(s)"). Thanks, Jan.

1.51   Sat Feb 13 10:31:55 1999
	- Fixed bugs in prefix matching in extract_variable:
	  	* incorrectly used default if '' specified
	* now handles $#array correctly
	- Fixed bugs in extract_codeblock:
	  * Now handles !~ properly
	  * Now handles embedded comments better.
	  * Now handles "raw" pattern matches better.
	- Added support for single strings or qr's as
	  'reject' and 'ignore' args to extract_tagged()
	- Added gen_extract_tagged() to "precompile"
	  a specific tag extractor for repeated use
	  (approximately 3 times faster!)

1.50   Thu Aug 27 09:20:19 1998
	- Improved the structure of the regex generated by
	  delimited_pat (and used in extract_delimited). It's
	  considerably more complex, but also more robust and
	  much faster in the worst case.
	- Altered extract_variable to accept whitespace in variables,
	  e.g. '$ a -> {'b'}     ->  [2]'

1.41   Mon Aug 10 14:51:50 1998
	- Reinstated change to extract_codeblock from 1.36 which were
	  mysteriously lost in 1.40

1.40   Tue Aug  4 13:54:52 1998
	- Added (optional) handling of embedded quoted text to
	  extract_delimited (see revised entry in Balanced.pod)
	- Added extract_tagged which extracts text between arbitrary,
	  optionally nested start and end tags (see new entry in
	  Balanced.pod).
	- Added delimited_pat which builds a pattern which matches a
	  string delimited by any of the delimiters specified (see new
	  entry in Balanced.pod).
	- Added test.pl

1.36   Tue Jul 14 12:26:04 1998
	- Reinstated POD file missing from previous distribution
	- Added undocumented fourth parameter to extract_codeblock
	  so as to correctly handle (?) and (s?) modifiers in
	  RecDescent grammars.

1.35   Wed Jun 24 09:53:31 1998
	- fixed handling of :: quantifiers in extract_variable()
	- numerous trivial lexical changes to make xemacs happy

1.24
	- changed behaviour in scalar contexts. Scalar contexts
	  now return the extracted string _and_ remove it from the
	  first argument (or $_).
	- changed return values on failure (all contexts return undef
	  for invalid return fields)
	- fixed some lurking bugs with trailing modifier handling
	- added :ALL tag to simplify wholesale importing of functions
	- fixed serious bug with embedded division operators ("/")
	  This now also allows the ?...? form of pattern matching!

1.23   Fri Oct 17 10:26:38 EST 1997
	- changed behaviour in scalar and void contexts. Scalar contexts
	  now return only the extracted string. Void contexts now remove
	  the extracted string from the first argument (or $_).

1.21   Sat Oct  4 17:21:54 EST 1997
	- synchronised with Parse::RecDescent distribution (version number
	  will now reflect that package)

1.10   Tue Sep 30 17:23:23 EST 1997
	- reworked extract_quotelike to correct handling of some obscure cases

1.01   Mon Sep  8 18:09:18 EST 1997
	- changed "quotemeta" to "quotemeta $_" to work
	  around bug in Perl 5.002 and 5.003

1.00   Mon Aug 11 12:42:56 1997
	- original version
