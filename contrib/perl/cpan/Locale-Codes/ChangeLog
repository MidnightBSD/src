ChangeLog for Locale-Codes Distribution

As of 3.00, the codes are autogenerated from the standards. With each release, codes will
be re-generated and tested to see if any code changed. Any time there are any changes to
the codes, it will be flagged below with a change: NEW CODE(s).

I intende to check for new codes at least twice a year (in June and December). I will
also check on request, so if a code changes that you use, feel free to contact me.
Any time there are new codes, I will add them to the module and release a new version.

          Jerry D. Hedden

3.10  2010-02-18 sbeck
        * NEW CODE(s)
        * Moved support files into the Locale::Codes namespace.
        * The work done in each of the Locale::XXX modules was
          virtually identical to each other. It has all been
          moved to a central module and the Locale::XXX moduels
          are now just wrappers.
        * The XXX_code2code functions would return undef if the
          same codeset were passed in for both the 2nd and
          3rd arguments. This doesn't make sense and has
          been changed.
        * Added all semi-private routines (except for the
          couple that were already present):
             rename_XXX
             add_XXX
             delete_XXX
             add_XXX_alias
             delete_XXX_alias
             rename_XXX_code
             add_XXX_code_alias
             delete_XXX_code_alias
        * Added "UK" alias. Steve Hay

3.01  2010-02-15 sbeck
        * Fixed Makefile.PL and Build.PL to install as core
          modules.

3.00  2010-02-10 sbeck
        * NEW CODE(s)
        * Took over maintenance of the code
        * All codes and country names come from the official
          standards
        * code2country now returns the name of the country specified
          in the standard (if the different standards refer
          to the country by different variations in the name,
          the results will differe based on the CODESET)
        * Added code sets
          FIPS 10 country codes
          Alpha-3 and Term language codes
          Numeric currency codes
        * The rename_country funcion from 2.07 would guess the
          CODESET (unlike all other functions which used
          a default of LOCALE_CODE_ALPHA_2). The guess can
          cause problems since (with the addition of FIPS)
          codes may appear in different codesets for different
          countries. The behavior has been changed to be
          the same as other functions (default to
          LOCALE_CODE_ALPHA_2).
        * Dropped support for _alias_code
        * Added language_code2code, currency_code2code

2.07  2004-06-10 neilb
        * made $_ local in the initialisation code for each module
          change back-propagated from Perl distribution
        * removed two non ISO-8859-1 characters from language names
          change back-propagated from Perl distribution
        * added the following aliases, with a test case for each
           - Burma added to Myanmar
           - French Southern and Antarctic Lands to
             French Southern Territories
          patch from TJ Mather
        * "Canadian Dollar" was mis-spelled as "Candian Dollar"
           - noted by Nick Cabatoff, patch from Michael Hennecke
        * Changes to Locale::Country reflecting changes in ISO 3166
           - added Aland Islands (ax, ala, 248)
           - YUGOSLAVIA is now SERBIA AND MONTENEGRO
              YU => CS
              YUG => SCG
              891 => 891 (unchanged)
              (YUGOSLAVIA retained as an alias)
           - EAST TIMOR changed to TIMOR-LESTE
              (old name retained as an alias)
           - three letter code for Romania changed from ROM to ROU
        * ZAIRE is now CONGO, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE
              ZR  => CD
              ZAR => COD
              180 => 180 (unchanged)
              (ZAIRE retained as alias)

2.06  2002-07-15 neilb

        * The four modules which have data after __DATA__ weren't
          closing the DATA filehandle after reading from it,
          which they should. Bug and patch from Steve Hay.

2.05  2002-07-08 neilb

        * Added three letter codes for the countries that were missing
          them. Patch from TJ Mather.
        * Documentation bug: one of the examples used => where the
          lvalue was a constant, which isn't allowed, unless you
          put the () with the constant to force the right interpretation.
          Pointed out by TJ Mather and MYT.
        * Updated the URL for the appendix in the CIA world factbook.
          Patch from TJ Mather.

2.04  2002-05-23 neilb

        * updated according to changes in ISO 3166-1 described
          in ISO 3166-1 newsletters V-4 and V-5, dated 2002-05-20:
           - Kazakstan is now "Kazakhstan"
           - Macau is now "Macao"
          The old names are retained as aliases.

          The alpha-2 and alpha-3 codes for East Timor have changed:
           tp -> tl
           tmp -> tls
          the numeric code stays 626. If you want to support the old
          codes, you can use the semi-private function alias_code().

2.03  2002-03-24 neilb

        * Fixed a typo in the alias for the Vatican, reported (with patch)
          by Philip Newton.
        * Added "Moldova" as an alias for "Moldova, Republic of"
        * Updated Makefile.PL to include AUTHOR and ABSTRACT

2.02  2002-03-09 neilb

        * added semi-private routine rename_country() to Locale::Country,
          based on a patch from Iain Chalmers.
        * added test rename.t for the above function.
        * renamed _alias_code to be alias_code. Have retained the old
          name for backwards compatibility. Will remove it when the
          major version number next changes.

2.01  2002-02-18 neilb

        * Split the documentation for all modules into separate pod files.
        * Made sure all =over were =over 4; some were other values.
        * The code2code() methods had one more shift than was needed.

2.00  2002-02-17 neilb

        * Created Locale::Script which provides an interface to the
          ISO codes for identification of scripts (writing scripts,
          rather than perl style scripts). The codes are defined
          by ISO 15924, which is currently in final draft.
          Thanks to Jarkko for pointing out this new standard.
          All three code sets are supported, and a test-suite added.

        * Added support for country name variants to Locale::Country,
          so that
           country2code('USA')
           country2code('United States')
           country2code('United States of America')
          will all return 'us'.
          This had been in the LIMITATIONS section since the first version.
          Patch from TJ Mather <tjmather@tjmather.com> with additional
          variants from me. Added test-cases for these.

        * Added VERSION to Locale::Constants. Thanks to Jarkko for
          pointing that it was missing.

        * Should really have bumped major version with previous release,
          since there was a change to the API.

1.06  2001-03-04 neilb

        Added Locale::Constants, which defines three symbols
        for identifying which codeset is being used:

           LOCALE_CODE_ALPHA_2
           LOCALE_CODE_ALPHA_3
           LOCALE_CODE_NUMERIC

        Updated Locale::Country to support all three code sets
        defined by ISO 3166. This was requested by Keith Wall.
        I haven't added multiple codeset support to the other
        modules yet - I'll wait until someone asks for them.

1.05  Feb 2001

        Added Locale::Currency, contribution from Michael Hennecke.
        Added testsuite for it (t/currency.t) and added testcases
        to t/all.t for the all_* functions.

1.04  Dec 2000

        Fixed very minor typos from 1.03!

1.03  Dec 2000

        Updated Locale::Country:
           - fixed spelling of a few countries
           - added link to a relevant page from CIA world factbook

        Updated Locale::Language:
           - fixed typo in the documentation (ISO 939 should be 639)

1.02  May 2000

        Updated Locale::Country and Locale::Language to reflect changes
        in the relevant ISO standards. These mainly reflect languages
        which are new to the relevant standard, and changes in the
        spelling of some country names.

        Added official URLs for the standards to the SEE ALSO sections
        of the doc for each module.

        Thanks to Jarkko Hietaniemi for pointing me at the pages
        with latest versions of ISO 3166 and 639.

1.00  March 1998

        Added Locale::Country::_alias_code() so that 'uk' can be added
        as the code for "United Kingdom", if you want it.
        This was prompted by Ed Jordan <ed@chronos.net>

        Added a new testsuite for handling this case, and extended the
        existing test-suite to include testing of the case where
        'uk' hasn't been defined as a valid code.

0.003 May 1997

        First public release to CPAN
