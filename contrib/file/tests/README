file tests
==========

This directory contains tests for file. It is highly encouraged to add
one each time a bug is found, and each time new magic is added. Each
test consists of three files:

  TEST.magic
  TEST.testfile
  TEST.result

where TEST is the base name of the test, TEST.magic contains the magic
used, TEST.testfile is the input, and TEST.result is the desired
output from file.

It suffices to add a triplet of test files to the directory to have
them included in "make check".
