Imported by:

	cvs import -m "Virgin import of Christos Zoulas's FILE 3.39." \
		src/contrib/file ZOULAS file_3_39


Never make local changes to ZOULAS `file'.  Christos is very willing to
work with us to meet our FreeBSD needs.  Thus submit any desired changes
to him <christos@zoulas.com> and wait for the next release and vendor
import to get them.
