# uuencode:  file(1) magic for ASCII-encoded files
#

# GRR:  the first line of xxencoded files is identical to that in uuencoded
# files, but the first character in most subsequent lines is 'h' instead of
# 'M'.  (xxencoding uses lowercase letters in place of most of uuencode's
# punctuation and survives BITNET gateways better.)  If regular expressions
# were supported, this entry could possibly be split into two with
# "begin\040\.\*\012M" or "begin\040\.\*\012h" (where \. and \* are REs).
0	string		begin\040	uuencoded or xxencoded text

# btoa(1) is an alternative to uuencode that requires less space.
0	string		xbtoa\ Begin	btoa'd text

# ship(1) is another, much cooler alternative to uuencode.
# Greg Roelofs, newt@uchicago.edu
0	string		$\012ship	ship'd binary text

# bencode(8) is used to encode compressed news batches (Bnews/Cnews only?)
# Greg Roelofs, newt@uchicago.edu
0	string	Decode\ the\ following\ with\ bdeco	bencoded News text

# BinHex is the Macintosh ASCII-encoded file format (see also "apple")
# Daniel Quinlan, quinlan@yggdrasil.com
11	string	must\ be\ converted\ with\ BinHex	BinHex binary text

# GRR:  is MIME BASE64 encoding handled somewhere?
