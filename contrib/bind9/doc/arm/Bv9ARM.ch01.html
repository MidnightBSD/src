CLASS="emphasis"

names</I
></SPAN
> that are organized as a tree according to
organizational or administrative boundaries. Each node of the tree,
called a <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>domain</I
></SPAN

node is the concatenation of all the labels on the path from the
node to the <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>root</I
></SPAN
> node.  This is represented
in written form as a string of labels listed from right to left and
separated by dots. A label need only be unique within its parent
domain.</P
><P
>For example, a domain name for a host at the
company <SPAN

<VAR

name of the host.</P
><P
>For administrative purposes, the name space is partitioned into
areas called <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>zones</I
></SPAN
>, each starting at a node and
extending down to the leaf nodes or to nodes where other zones start.
The data for each zone is stored in a <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>name
server</I
></SPAN
>, which answers queries about the zone using the
<SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"

form of <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"

CLASS="emphasis"
>resource records</I
></SPAN

CLASS="acronym"

Some of the supported resource record types are described in

>To properly operate a name server, it is important to understand
the difference between a <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"

CLASS="emphasis"
>zone</I
></SPAN

and a <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>domain</I
></SPAN

><P
>As we stated previously, a zone is a point of delegation in
the <ACRONYM
CLASS="acronym"
>DNS</ACRONYM
> tree. A zone consists of
those contiguous parts of the domain
tree for which a name server has complete information and over which
it has authority. It contains all domain names from a certain point
downward in the domain tree except those which are delegated to
other zones. A delegation point is marked by one or more
<SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>NS records</I
></SPAN
> in the
parent zone, which should be matched by equivalent NS records at
the root of the delegated zone.</P
><P
>For instance, consider the <VAR
CLASS="literal"
>example.com</VAR
>
domain which includes names
such as <VAR
CLASS="literal"
>host.aaa.example.com</VAR
> and
<VAR
CLASS="literal"
>host.bbb.example.com</VAR
> even though
the <VAR
CLASS="literal"
>example.com</VAR
> zone includes
only delegations for the <VAR
CLASS="literal"
>aaa.example.com</VAR
> and
<VAR
CLASS="literal"
>bbb.example.com</VAR
> zones.  A zone can map
exactly to a single domain, but could also include only part of a
domain, the rest of which could be delegated to other
name servers. Every name in the <ACRONYM
CLASS="acronym"
>DNS</ACRONYM
> tree is a
<SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>domain</I
></SPAN
>, even if it is
<SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>terminal</I
></SPAN
>, that is, has no
<SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>subdomains</I
></SPAN
>.  Every subdomain is a domain and
every domain except the root is also a subdomain. The terminology is
not intuitive and we suggest that you read RFCs 1033, 1034 and 1035 to
gain a complete understanding of this difficult and subtle
topic.</P
><P
>Though <ACRONYM
CLASS="acronym"
>BIND</ACRONYM
> is called a "domain name server",
it deals primarily in terms of zones. The master and slave
declarations in the <TT
CLASS="filename"
>named.conf</TT
> file specify
zones, not domains. When you ask some other site if it is willing to
be a slave server for your <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>domain</I
></SPAN
>, you are
actually asking for slave service for some collection of zones.</P

To make the DNS tolerant of server and network failures,
most zones have two or more authoritative servers.
</P

the Internet servers. A typical scenario would involve a number
of internal <ACRONYM

to pass packets through the firewall would forward to the server
that can do it, and that server would query the Internet <ACRONYM

feature is that the central machine develops a much more complete
