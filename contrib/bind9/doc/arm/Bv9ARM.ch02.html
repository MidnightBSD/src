>The memory of the server has to be large enough to fit the
cache and zones loaded off disk.  The <B

option can be used to limit the amount of memory used by the cache,
at the expense of reducing cache hit rates and causing more <ACRONYM
CLASS="acronym"

traffic. It is still good practice to have enough memory to load
all zone and cache data into memory &#8212; unfortunately, the best way
to determine this for a given installation is to watch the name server
in operation. After a few weeks the server process should reach
a relatively stable size where entries are expiring from the cache as
fast as they are being inserted.</P

><P
>For name server intensive environments, there are two alternative
configurations that may be used. The first is where clients and
any second-level internal name servers query a main name server, which
has enough memory to build a large cache. This approach minimizes
the bandwidth used by external name lookups. The second alternative
is to set up second-level internal name servers to make queries independently.
In this configuration, none of the individual machines needs to
have as much memory or CPU power as in the first alternative, but
this has the disadvantage of making many more external queries,
as none of the name servers share their cached data.</P
