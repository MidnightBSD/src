Abstract

   Use of the TSIG DNS resource record requires specification of a
   cryptographic message authentication code.  Currently identifiers
   have been specified only for the HMAC-MD5 and GSS TSIG algorithms.
   This document standardizes identifiers and implementation
   requirements for additional HMAC SHA TSIG algorithms and standardizes
   how to specify and handle the truncation of HMAC values.

INTERNET-DRAFT                                 HMAC-SHA TSIG Identifiers


1. Introduction

   [RFC 2845] specifies a TSIG Resource Record (RR) that can be used to
   authenticate DNS queries and responses. This RR contains a domain
   name syntax data item which names the authentication algorithm used.
   [RFC 2845] defines the HMAC-MD5.SIG-ALG.REG.INT name for
   authentication codes using the HMAC [RFC 2104] algorithm with the MD5
   [RFC 1321] hash algorithm. IANA has also registered "gss-tsig" as an
   identifier for TSIG authentication where the cryptographic operations
   are delegated to GSS [RFC 3645].

   In Section 2, this document specifies additional names for TSIG
   authentication algorithms based on US NIST SHA algorithms and HMAC
   and specifies the implementation requirements for those algorithms.

   In Section 3, this document specifies the meaning of inequality
   between the normal output size of the specified hash function and the
   length of MAC (message authentication code) data given in the TSIG
   RR. In particular, it specifies that a shorter length field value
   specifies truncation and a longer length field is an error.

   In Section 4, policy restrictions and implications related to
   truncation and a new error code to indicate truncation shorter than
   permitted by policy are described and specified.

   The use herein of MUST, SHOULD, MAY, MUST NOT, and SHOULD NOT is as
   defined in [RFC 2119].

2. Algorithms and Identifiers

   TSIG Resource Records (RRs) [RFC 2845] are used to authenticate DNS
   queries and responses.  They are intended to be efficient symmetric
   authentication codes based on a shared secret. (Asymmetric signatures
   can be provided using the SIG RR [RFC 2931]. In particular, SIG(0)
   can be used for transaction signatures.) Used with a strong hash
   function, HMAC [RFC 2104] provides a way to calculate such symmetric
   authentication codes. The only specified HMAC based TSIG algorithm
   identifier has been HMAC-MD5.SIG-ALG.REG.INT based on MD5 [RFC 1321].

   The use of SHA-1 [FIPS 180-2, RFC 3174], which is a 160 bit hash, as
   compared with the 128 bits for MD5, and additional hash algorithms in
   the SHA family [FIPS 180-2, RFC 3874, SHA2draft] with 224, 256, 384,
   and 512 bits, may be preferred in some cases particularly since
   increasingly successful cryptanalytic attacks are being made on the
   shorter hashes.  Use of TSIG between a DNS resolver and server is by
   mutual agreement. That agreement can include the support of
   additional algorithms and may specify policies as to which algorithms
   and truncations are acceptable subject to the restrication and
   guidelines in Section 3 and 4 below.

   The current HMAC-MD5.SIG-ALG.REG.INT identifier is included in the
   table below for convenience.  Implementations which support TSIG MUST
   also implement HMAC SHA1 and HMAC SHA256 and MAY implement gss-tsig
   and the other algorithms listed below.

         Mandatory      HMAC-MD5.SIG-ALG.REG.INT
         Mandatory      hmac-sha1
         Optional       hmac-sha224
         Mandatory      hmac-sha256
         Optional       hamc-sha384
         Optional       hmac-sha512

3. Specifying Truncation

   When space is at a premium and the strength of the full length of an
   HMAC is not needed, it is reasonable to truncate the HMAC output and
   use the truncated value for authentication. HMAC SHA-1 truncated to
   96 bits is an option available in several IETF protocols including
   IPSEC and TLS.

   The TSIG RR [RFC 2845] includes a "MAC size" field, which gives the
   size of the MAC field in octets. But [RFC 2845] does not specify what
   to do if this MAC size differs from the length of the output of HMAC
   for a particular hash function. Truncation is indicated by a MAC size
   less than the HMAC size as specified below.



3.1 Truncation Specification

   The specification for TSIG handling is changed as follows:

   1. If "MAC size" field is greater than HMAC output length:
         This case MUST NOT be generated and if received MUST cause the
      packet to be dropped and RCODE 1 (FORMERR) to be returned.

   2. If "MAC size" field equals HMAC output length:
         Operation is as described in [RFC 2845] with the entire output
      HMAC output present.

   3. "MAC size" field is less than HMAC output length but greater than
      that specified in case 4 below:
         This is sent when the signer has truncated the HMAC output to
      an allowable length, as described in RFC 2104, taking initial
      octets and discarding trailing octets. TSIG truncation can only be
      to an integral number of octets. On receipt of a packet with
      truncation thus indicated, the locally calculated MAC is similarly
      truncated and only the truncated values compared for
      authentication. The request MAC used when calculating the TSIG MAC
      for a reply is the trucated request MAC.

   4. "MAC size" field is less than the larger of 10 (octets) and half
      the length of the hash function in use:
         With the exception of certain TSIG error messages described in
      RFC 2845 section 3.2 where it is permitted that the MAC size be
      zero, this case MUST NOT be generated and if received MUST cause
      the packet to be dropped and RCODE 1 (FORMERR) to be returned. The
      size limit for this case can also, for the hash functions
      mentioned in this document, be stated as less than half the hash
      function length for hash functions other than MD5 and less than 10
      octets for MD5.

4. TSIG Policy Provisions and Truncation Error

   Use of TSIG is by mutual agreement between a resolver and server.
   Implicit in such "agreement" are policies as to acceptable keys and
   algorithms and, with the extensions in this doucment, truncations. In
   particular note the following:

      Such policies MAY require the rejection of TSIGs even though they
   use an algorithm for which implementation is mandatory.

      When a policy calls for the acceptance of a TSIG with a particular
   algorithm and a particular non-zero amount of trunction it SHOULD
   also permit the use of that algorithm with lesser truncation (a
   longer MAC) up to the full HMAC output.

      Regardless of a lower acceptable truncated MAC length specified by
   policy, a reply SHOULD be sent with a MAC at least as long as that in
   the corresponding request unless the request specified a MAC length
   longer than the HMAC output.

      Implementations permitting policies with multiple acceptable
   algorithms and/or truncations SHOULD permit this list to be ordered
   by presumed strength and SHOULD allow different truncations for the
   same algorithm to be treatred as spearate entities in this list. When
   so implemented, policies SHOULD accept a presumed stronger algorithm
   and truncation than the minimum strength required by the policy.

      If a TSIG is received with truncation which is permitted under
   Section 3 above but the MAC is too short for the policy in force, an
   RCODE of TBA [22 suggested](BADTRUNC) MUST be returned.

5. IANA Considerations

   This document, on approval for publication as a standards track RFC,
   (1) registers the new TSIG algorithm identifiers listed in Section 2
   with IANA and (2) Section 4 allocates the BADTRUNC RCODE TBA [22
   suggested].




6. Security Considerations

   For all of the message authentication code algorithms listed herein,
   those producing longer values are believed to be stronger; however,
   while there have been some arguments that mild truncation can
   strengthen a MAC by reducing the information available to an
   attacker, excessive truncation clearly weakens authentication by
   reducing the number of bits an attacker has to try to brute force
   [RFC 2104].

   Significant progress has been made recently in cryptanalysis of hash
   function of the type used herein, all of which ultimately derive from
   the design of MD4. While the results so far should not effect HMAC,
   the stronger SHA-1 and SHA-256 algorithms are being made mandatory
   due to caution.

   See the Security Considerations section of [RFC 2845].  See also the
   Security Considerations section of [RFC 2104] from which the limits
   on truncation in this RFC were taken.
