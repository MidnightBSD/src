/*
 * "length" is the overall packet length, including the entire packet header.
 *
 * "version" specifies the header format.  Currently, there is only one
 * format, LWRES_LWPACKETVERSION_0.
 *
 * "flags" specifies library-defined flags for this packet.  None of these
 * are definable by the caller, but library-defined values can be set by
 * the caller.  For example, one bit in this field indicates if the packet
 * is a request or a response.
 *
 * "serial" is set by the requestor and is returned in all replies.  If two
 * packets from the same source have the same serial number and are from
 * the same source, they are assumed to be duplicates and the latter ones
 * may be dropped.  (The library does not do this by default on replies, but
 * does so on requests.)
 *
 * "opcode" is application defined.  Opcodes between 0x04000000 and 0xffffffff
 * are application defined.  Opcodes between 0x00000000 and 0x03ffffff are
 * reserved for library use.
 *
 * "result" is application defined, and valid only on replies.
 * Results between 0x04000000 and 0xffffffff are application defined.
 * Results between 0x00000000 and 0x03ffffff are reserved for library use.
 * (This is the same reserved range defined in <isc/resultclass.h>, so it
 * would be trivial to map ISC_R_* result codes into packet result codes
 * when appropriate.)
 *
 * "recvlength" is set to the maximum buffer size that the receiver can
 * handle on requests, and the size of the buffer needed to satisfy a request
 * when the buffer is too large for replies.
 *
 * "authtype" is the packet level auth type used.
 * Authtypes between 0x1000 and 0xffff are application defined.  Authtypes
 * between 0x0000 and 0x0fff are reserved for library use.  This is currently
 * unused and MUST be set to zero.
 *
 * "authlen" is the length of the authentication data.  See the specific
 * authtypes for more information on what is contained in this field.  This
 * is currently unused, and MUST be set to zero.
 *
 * The remainder of the packet consists of two regions, one described by
 * "authlen" and one of "length - authlen - sizeof(lwres_lwpacket_t)".
 *
 * That is:
 *
 *	pkt header
 *	authlen bytes of auth information
 *	data bytes
 */

/*
 * Currently defined opcodes:
 *
 *	NOOP.  Success is always returned, with the packet contents echoed.
 *
 *	GETADDRSBYNAME.  Return all known addresses for a given name.
 *		This may return NIS or /etc/hosts info as well as DNS
 *		information.  Flags will be provided to indicate ip4/ip6
 *		addresses are desired.
 *
 *	GETNAMEBYADDR.	Return the hostname for the given address.  Once
 *		again, it will return data from multiple sources.
