.SH "NAME"
lwres_net_ntop \- lightweight resolver IP address presentation
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.nf
#include <lwres/net.h>
.fi
.HP 28
\fBconst\ char\ *\ \fBlwres_net_ntop\fR\fR\fB(\fR\fBint\ af\fR\fB, \fR\fBconst\ void\ *src\fR\fB, \fR\fBchar\ *dst\fR\fB, \fR\fBsize_t\ size\fR\fB);\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBlwres_net_ntop()\fR
converts an IP address of protocol family
\fIaf\fR
\(em IPv4 or IPv6 \(em at location
\fIsrc\fR
from network format to its conventional representation as a string. For IPv4 addresses, that string would be a dotted\-decimal. An IPv6 address would be represented in colon notation as described in RFC1884.
.PP
The generated string is copied to
\fIdst\fR
provided
\fIsize\fR
indicates it is long enough to store the ASCII representation of the address.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.PP
If successful, the function returns
\fIdst\fR: a pointer to a string containing the presentation format of the address.
\fBlwres_net_ntop()\fR
returns
\fBNULL\fR
and sets the global variable
\fBerrno\fR
to
\fBEAFNOSUPPORT\fR
if the protocol family given in
\fIaf\fR
is not supported.
