.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBlwres_getrrsetbyname()\fR
gets a set of resource records associated with a
\fIhostname\fR,
\fIclass\fR, and
\fItype\fR.
\fIhostname\fR
is a pointer a to null\-terminated string. The
\fIflags\fR
field is currently unused and must be zero.
.PP
After a successful call to
\fBlwres_getrrsetbyname()\fR,
\fI*res\fR
is a pointer to an
\fBrrsetinfo\fR
structure, containing a list of one or more
\fBrdatainfo\fR
structures containing resource records and potentially another list of
\fBrdatainfo\fR
structures containing SIG resource records associated with those records. The members
\fBrri_rdclass\fR
and
\fBrri_rdtype\fR
are copied from the parameters.
\fBrri_ttl\fR
and
\fBrri_name\fR
are properties of the obtained rrset. The resource records contained in
\fBrri_rdatas\fR
and
\fBrri_sigs\fR
are in uncompressed DNS wire format. Properties of the rdataset are represented in the
\fBrri_flags\fR
bitfield. If the RRSET_VALIDATED bit is set, the data has been DNSSEC validated and the signatures verified.
.PP
All of the information returned by
\fBlwres_getrrsetbyname()\fR
is dynamically allocated: the
\fBrrsetinfo\fR
and
\fBrdatainfo\fR
structures, and the canonical host name strings pointed to by the
\fBrrsetinfo\fRstructure. Memory allocated for the dynamically allocated structures created by a successful call to
\fBlwres_getrrsetbyname()\fR
is released by
\fBlwres_freerrset()\fR.
\fIrrset\fR
is a pointer to a
\fBstruct rrset\fR
created by a call to
\fBlwres_getrrsetbyname()\fR.
.PP
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.PP
\fBlwres_getrrsetbyname()\fR
returns zero on success, and one of the following error codes if an error occurred:
.TP
\fBERRSET_NONAME\fR
the name does not exist
.TP
\fBERRSET_NODATA\fR
the name exists, but does not have data of the desired type
.TP
\fBERRSET_NOMEMORY\fR
memory could not be allocated
.TP
\fBERRSET_INVAL\fR
a parameter is invalid
.TP
\fBERRSET_FAIL\fR
other failure
.TP
