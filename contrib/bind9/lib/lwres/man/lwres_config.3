.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBlwres_conf_init()\fR
creates an empty
\fBlwres_conf_t\fR
structure for lightweight resolver context
\fIctx\fR.
.PP
\fBlwres_conf_clear()\fR
frees up all the internal memory used by that
\fBlwres_conf_t\fR
structure in resolver context
\fIctx\fR.
.PP
\fBlwres_conf_parse()\fR
opens the file
\fIfilename\fR
and parses it to initialise the resolver context
\fIctx\fR's
\fBlwres_conf_t\fR
structure.
.PP
\fBlwres_conf_print()\fR
prints the
\fBlwres_conf_t\fR
structure for resolver context
\fIctx\fR
to the
\fBFILE\fR\fIfp\fR.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.PP
\fBlwres_conf_parse()\fR
returns
\fBLWRES_R_SUCCESS\fR
if it successfully read and parsed
\fIfilename\fR. It returns
\fBLWRES_R_FAILURE\fR
if
\fIfilename\fR
could not be opened or contained incorrect resolver statements.
.PP
\fBlwres_conf_print()\fR
returns
\fBLWRES_R_SUCCESS\fR
unless an error occurred when converting the network addresses to a numeric host address string. If this happens, the function returns
\fBLWRES_R_FAILURE\fR.
