.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBlwres_herror()\fR
prints the string
\fIs\fR
on
\fBstderr\fR
followed by the string generated by
\fBlwres_hstrerror()\fR
for the error code stored in the global variable
\fBlwres_h_errno\fR.
.PP
\fBlwres_hstrerror()\fR
returns an appropriate string for the error code gievn by
\fIerr\fR. The values of the error codes and messages are as follows:
.TP
\fBNETDB_SUCCESS\fR
Resolver Error 0 (no error)
.TP
\fBHOST_NOT_FOUND\fR
Unknown host
.TP
\fBTRY_AGAIN\fR
Host name lookup failure
.TP
\fBNO_RECOVERY\fR
Unknown server error
.TP
\fBNO_DATA\fR
No address associated with name
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.PP
The string
Unknown resolver error
is returned by
\fBlwres_hstrerror()\fR
when the value of
\fBlwres_h_errno\fR
is not a valid error code.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
\fBherror\fR(3),
\fBlwres_hstrerror\fR(3).
