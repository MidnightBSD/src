/*
 * DNS Resolver
 *
 * This is the BIND 9 resolver, the module responsible for resolving DNS
 * requests by iteratively querying authoritative servers and following
 * referrals.  This is a "full resolver", not to be confused with
 * the stub resolvers most people associate with the word "resolver".
 * The full resolver is part of the caching name server or resolver
 * daemon the stub resolver talks to.
 *
 * MP:
 *	The module ensures appropriate synchronization of data structures it
 *	creates and manipulates.
 *
 * Reliability:
 *	No anticipated impact.
 *
 * Resources:
 *	<TBS>
 *
 * Security:
 *	No anticipated impact.
 *
 * Standards:
 *	RFCs:	1034, 1035, 2181, <TBS>
 *	Drafts:	<TBS>
