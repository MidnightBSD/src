 ***** Module Info
 *****/

/*
 * DNS Names and Labels
 *
 * Provides facilities for manipulating DNS names and labels, including
 * conversions to and from wire format and text format.
 *
 * Given the large number of names possible in a nameserver, and because
 * names occur in rdata, it was important to come up with a very efficient
 * way of storing name data, but at the same time allow names to be
 * manipulated.  The decision was to store names in uncompressed wire format,
 * and not to make them fully abstracted objects; i.e. certain parts of the
 * server know names are stored that way.  This saves a lot of memory, and
 * makes adding names to messages easy.  Having much of the server know
 * the representation would be perilous, and we certainly don't want each
 * user of names to be manipulating such a low-level structure.  This is
 * where the Names and Labels module comes in.  The module allows name or
 * label handles to be created and attached to uncompressed wire format
 * regions.  All name operations and conversions are done through these
 * handles.
 *
 * MP:
 *	Clients of this module must impose any required synchronization.
 *
 * Reliability:
 *	This module deals with low-level byte streams.  Errors in any of
 *	the functions are likely to crash the server or corrupt memory.
 *
 * Resources:
 *	None.
 *
 * Security:
 *
 *	*** WARNING ***
 *
 *	dns_name_fromwire() deals with raw network data.  An error in
 *	this routine could result in the failure or hijacking of the server.
 *
 * Standards:
 *	RFC 1035
 *	Draft EDNS0 (0)
 *	Draft Binary Labels (2)
