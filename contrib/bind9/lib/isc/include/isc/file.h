 *	The path is prepended to an implementation-defined string and

 * Notes:

 *	about the spelling of 'templet', first look it up in the
 *	Merriam-Webster English dictionary. (http://www.m-w.com/)
 *
 *	This function works by using the template to generate file names.
 *	The template must be a writable string, as it is modified in place.
 *	Trailing X characters in the file name (full file name on Unix,
 *	basename on Win32 -- eg, tmp-XXXXXX vs XXXXXX.tmp, respectively)
 *	are replaced with ASCII characters until a non-existent filename
 *	is found.  If the template does not include pathname information,
 *	the files in the working directory of the program are searched.
 *
 *	isc_file_mktemplate is a good, portable way to get a template.
 *
 * Requires:
 *	'fp' is non-NULL and '*fp' is NULL.
 *
 *	'template' is non-NULL, and of a form suitable for use by
 *	the system as described above.
 *
 * Ensures:
 *	If result is ISC_R_SUCCESS:
 *		*fp points to an stream opening in stdio's "w+" mode.
 *
 *	If result is not ISC_R_SUCCESS:
 *		*fp is NULL.
 *
 *		No file is open.  Even if one was created (but unable
 *		to be reopened as a stdio FILE pointer) then it has been
 *		removed.
 *
 *	This function does *not* ensure that the template string has not been
 *	modified, even if the operation was unsuccessful.
 *
 * Returns:
 *	ISC_R_SUCCESS
 *		Success.
 *	ISC_R_EXISTS
 *		No file with a unique name could be created based on the
 *		template.
 *	ISC_R_INVALIDFILE
 *		The path specified was not usable by the operating system.
 *	ISC_R_NOPERM
 *		The file could not be created because permission was denied
 *		to some part of the file's path.
 *	ISC_R_EIO
 *		Hardware error interacting with the filesystem.
