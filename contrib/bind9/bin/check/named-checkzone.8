.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBnamed\-checkzone\fR
checks the syntax and integrity of a zone file. It performs the same checks as
\fBnamed\fR
does when loading a zone. This makes
\fBnamed\-checkzone\fR
useful for checking zone files before configuring them into a name server.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP 3n
\-d
Enable debugging.
.TP 3n
\-q
Quiet mode \- exit code only.
.TP 3n
\-v
Print the version of the
\fBnamed\-checkzone\fR
program and exit.
.TP 3n
\-j
When loading the zone file read the journal if it exists.
.TP 3n
\-c \fIclass\fR
Specify the class of the zone. If not specified "IN" is assumed.
.TP 3n
\-k \fImode\fR
Perform
\fB"check\-names"\fR
checks with the specified failure mode. Possible modes are
\fB"fail"\fR,
\fB"warn"\fR
(default) and
\fB"ignore"\fR.
.TP 3n
\-n \fImode\fR
Specify whether NS records should be checked to see if they are addresses. Possible modes are
\fB"fail"\fR,
\fB"warn"\fR
(default) and
\fB"ignore"\fR.
.TP 3n
\-o \fIfilename\fR
Write zone output to
\fIfilename\fR.
.TP 3n
\-t \fIdirectory\fR
chroot to
\fIdirectory\fR
so that include directives in the configuration file are processed as if run by a similarly chrooted named.
.TP 3n
\-w \fIdirectory\fR
chdir to
\fIdirectory\fR
so that relative filenames in master file $INCLUDE directives work. This is similar to the directory clause in
\fInamed.conf\fR.
.TP 3n
\-D
Dump zone file in canonical format.
.TP 3n
zonename
The domain name of the zone being checked.
.TP 3n
filename
The name of the zone file.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.PP
\fBnamed\-checkzone\fR
returns an exit status of 1 if errors were detected and 0 otherwise.
