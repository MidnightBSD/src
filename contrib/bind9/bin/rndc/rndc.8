.SH NAME
rndc \- name server control utility
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBrndc\fR [ \fB-c \fIconfig-file\fB\fR ]  [ \fB-k \fIkey-file\fB\fR ]  [ \fB-s \fIserver\fB\fR ]  [ \fB-p \fIport\fB\fR ]  [ \fB-V\fR ]  [ \fB-y \fIkey_id\fB\fR ]  \fBcommand\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBrndc\fR controls the operation of a name
server. It supersedes the \fBndc\fR utility
that was provided in old BIND releases. If
\fBrndc\fR is invoked with no command line
options or arguments, it prints a short summary of the
supported commands and the available options and their
arguments.
.PP
\fBrndc\fR communicates with the name server
over a TCP connection, sending commands authenticated with
digital signatures. In the current versions of
\fBrndc\fR and \fBnamed\fR named
the only supported authentication algorithm is HMAC-MD5,
which uses a shared secret on each end of the connection.
This provides TSIG-style authentication for the command
request and the name server's response. All commands sent
over the channel must be signed by a key_id known to the
server.
.PP
\fBrndc\fR reads a configuration file to
determine how to contact the name server and decide what
algorithm and key it should use.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-c \fIconfig-file\fB\fR
Use \fIconfig-file\fR
as the configuration file instead of the default,
\fI/etc/rndc.conf\fR.
.TP
\fB-k \fIkey-file\fB\fR
Use \fIkey-file\fR
as the key file instead of the default,
\fI/etc/rndc.key\fR. The key in
\fI/etc/rndc.key\fR will be used to authenticate
commands sent to the server if the \fIconfig-file\fR
does not exist.
.TP
\fB-s \fIserver\fB\fR
\fIserver\fR is
the name or address of the server which matches a
server statement in the configuration file for
\fBrndc\fR. If no server is supplied on the
command line, the host named by the default-server clause
in the option statement of the configuration file will be
used.
.TP
\fB-p \fIport\fB\fR
Send commands to TCP port
\fIport\fR instead
of BIND 9's default control channel port, 953.
.TP
\fB-V\fR
Enable verbose logging.
.TP
\fB-y \fIkeyid\fB\fR
Use the key \fIkeyid\fR
from the configuration file.
\fIkeyid\fR must be
known by named with the same algorithm and secret string
in order for control message validation to succeed.
If no \fIkeyid\fR
is specified, \fBrndc\fR will first look
for a key clause in the server statement of the server
being used, or if no server statement is present for that
host, then the default-key clause of the options statement.
Note that the configuration file contains shared secrets
which are used to send authenticated control commands
to name servers. It should therefore not have general read
or write access.
.PP
For the complete set of commands supported by \fBrndc\fR,
see the BIND 9 Administrator Reference Manual or run
\fBrndc\fR without arguments to see its help message.
.PP
.SH "LIMITATIONS"
.PP
\fBrndc\fR does not yet support all the commands of
the BIND 8 \fBndc\fR utility.
.PP
There is currently no way to provide the shared secret for a
\fBkey_id\fR without using the configuration file.
.PP
Several error messages could be clearer.
