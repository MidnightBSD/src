Hi,

To just generate the manual in portuguese, download the file
cvs.texinfo from the actual directory and compile the manual with:

makeinfo --html cvs.texinfo

If you what to help with the translation, send a message to
bug-cvs@nongnu.org and told us what peace you want to translate.

Some policy:

* commit just a compileable version

* don't erase original text. comment original text with '@c <en>'.

* don't translate comments in english (starting with '@c '. leave them
  untouched

* don't translate examples. let's concentrate in finish the work
  first.
