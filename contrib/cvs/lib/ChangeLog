2000-02-16  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

1999-12-29  Jim Kingdon  <http://developer.redhat.com/>

	* Makefile.in: There was a comment here which referred to a long
	comment in configure.in about regex.o (the configure.in comment
	isn't there any more).  Replace our comment with a conciser
	version of the former configure.in comment.

1999-03-26  Jim Kingdon  <http://www.cyclic.com>

	* getopt.h: Don't declare the arguments to getopt.

1999-02-09  Jim Kingdon  <http://www.cyclic.com>

	* vasprintf.c: Removed; there is apparently no clean, portable
	solution to the VA_LIST_IS_ARRAY problem (C9X drafts have va_copy,
	but we aren't even assuming C90 yet!).
	* Makefile.in (SOURCES): Remove vasprintf.c.
	* build_lib.com: Remove vasprintf.c and vasprintf.obj.

1999-01-26  Jim Kingdon  <http://www.cyclic.com>
	and Joerg Bullmann  <http://www.glink.net.hk/~jb/MacCVSClient/>

	* fnmatch.c: Use FOLD_FN_CHAR in two cases where it had been
	omitted.

1999-01-22  Jim Kingdon  <http://www.cyclic.com>

	* fnmatch.c: Include system.h; FOLD_FN_CHAR has moved there from
	config.h (from Alexey Milov).  Don't define our own FOLD_FN_CHAR;
	that just masks cases in which we got the includes tangled up.

1999-01-12  Jim Kingdon  <http://www.cyclic.com>

	* memmove.c: Remove paragraph which contained the FSF's old
	snail mail address; it has changed.

1999-01-05  Jim Kingdon  <http://www.cyclic.com>

	* md5.c, md5.h: Rename all the external interfaces to start with
	cvs_* to avoid namespace pollution problems.  Include string.h
	unconditionally, to avoid gcc -Wall warnings on memset.

1998-12-29  Jim Kingdon  <http://www.cyclic.com>

	* getdate.y (RelativeMonth): Add 1900 to tm_year, so that in 2000,
	we pass 2000, not 100, to Convert.
	(Convert): Add comment about Year argument.
	* getdate.c: Regenerated using byacc.

Tue Mar 24 16:08:00 1998  Ian Lance Taylor  <ian@cygnus.com>

	* Makefile.in (CFLAGS): Set to @CFLAGS@, not -g.

1998-02-20  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* regex.c: Partial merge with version from emacs 20.2.  Brings
	over some trivial changes (whitespace and so on) (most such
	changes I didn't bother with, for this time).  Don't cast to int
	before comparing old_regend[r] to regstart[r] (this is the point
	of bothering; the old code was broken for 64 bit machines.
	Reported by Paul Vixie).

Tue Feb 17 18:33:26 1998  Ian Lance Taylor  <ian@cygnus.com>

	* memmove.c: New file, resurrecting the old one.
	* Makefile.in (SOURCES): Add memmove.c.

1998-02-03  Tim Pierce  <twp@skepsis.com>

	* system.h (CVS_LSTAT): New macro.

	* getline.h (getstr): Declare.

13 Jan 1998  Jim Kingdon

	* fncase.c: Include config.h before system.h.

	* system.h: Just include string.h unconditionally.  We already
	include it unconditionally elsewhere.

Tue Jan 13 16:51:59 1998  Ian Lance Taylor  <ian@cygnus.com>

	* fncase.c: New file, taken from windows-NT/filesubr.c.
	* system.h: If __CYGWIN32__ or WIN32 are defined, define
	FOLD_FN_CHAR, FILENAMES_CASE_INSENSITIVE, and ISDIRSEP, and
	declare fncmp and fnfold.  Taken from windows-NT/config.h.
	* Makefile.in (SOURCES): Add fncase.c.

Sat Jan 10 10:51:26 1998  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* getline.c (getstr): Make sure to set errno when appropriate.  I
	didn't test the error case for the new code but inspection shows
	the old code was rather broken.

Sat Nov 29 22:03:39 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	getwd and getcwd were a big big mess.  Although Jim's fix might
	indeed be fixing a typo, the code is so tangled that I would guess
	it probably breaks some system.  So clean this up:
	* xgetwd.c: Always assume we have getcwd (we had been anyway,
	before Jim's change).
	* getwd.c: Removed.
	* Makefile.in: Remove getwd.c
	* system.h: Remove declarations of getwd and getcwd.  Move getcwd
	declaration to the !HAVE_UNISTD_H section.

1997-11-29  Jim Meyering  <meyering@na-net.ornl.gov>

	* xgetwd.c: Fix typo s/ifndef/ifdef/ in test of HAVE_GETWD.

Wed Nov 26 10:12:33 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* system.h: Always use "rb" and "wb".  Check for O_BINARY with an
	#ifdef, not the error-prone LINES_CRLF_TERMINATED.

Thu Sep 25 10:57:39 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* getdate.y (get_date): If gmtime returns NULL, try to cope.
	* getdate.c: Regenerated using byacc.

	* getdate.y: Remove comment about sending email concerning this file
	to Rich Salz.
	* getdate.c: Regenerated using byacc.

Wed Sep 24 10:35:38 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in (OBJECTS): Add regex.o.

Wed Sep 17 16:37:17 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* getdate.y (ToSeconds): For am or pm, a hour of "12" really means 0.
	* getdate.c: Regenerated using byacc (not bison per comment).

Tue Sep  9 20:51:45 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* build_lib.com: Add vasprintf.c and vasprintf.obj.

	* build_lib.com: Remove strippath.obj from library/create command.

Sun Sep  7 17:35:27 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* system.h: Replace comment referring to ChangeLog with a
	comment based on the ChangeLog entries.

	* strdup.c: Removed, per change to ../configure.in
	* Makefile.in (SOURCES): Remove strdup.c.

Mon Jun 16 18:59:50 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* system.h: Add CVS_FNMATCH.

Sun Jun  8 23:41:11 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* system.h (mkfifo): Remove; not used anywhere.

Thu Mar  6 17:14:49 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* regex.c: Partial merge with version from emacs 19.34.  I brought
	over most trivial changes (whitespace and so on).  Most of the
	changes to portability cruft I did not bring over, on the theory
	of sticking to the devil that we know.  I did bring over the
	change to undef MAX and MIN (this is a better solution to a
	problem we had been handling a different way).  There were a
	variety of changes I probably could/should have brought over, but
	elected not to try to understand them and whether they would cause
	trouble (printchar -> putchar, changes to output format in
	print_partial_compiled_pattern, internationalization,
	FREE_STACK_RETURN and friends which would appear to be fixing
	memory leaks in error cases, RE_TRANSLATE_TYPE, and others).  I
	did merge the changes (union fail_stack_elt, PUSH_FAILURE_POINTER,
	etc.) to use a union for the failure stack rather than playing
	games with pointers and integers (that was my reason for
	bothering; the code had been broken on the Alpha).

Mon Feb 10 18:52:18 1997  Ullrich von Bassewitz <uz@musoftware.com>

	* md5.c: Make the parameter to getu32 const since the function will
        only read the values and this will avoid compiler warnings in other
        places.

Mon Feb 10 18:29:04 1997  Ullrich von Bassewitz <uz@musoftware.com>

	* vasprintf.c: Added a #define for systems where a va_list is
	defined as an array, not as a pointer.

Mon Feb 10 09:31:38 1997  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@cygnus.com>

	* md5.c (MD5STEP): Truncate to 32 bits before shifting right.

Thu Jan 30 11:35:26 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* regex.h: Don't prototype re_comp and re_exec.

Tue Jan 28 17:45:46 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* md5.c, md5.h: Changes so these work without having an integer
	type which is exactly 32 bits.  Modeled after changes by Tatu Ylonen
	<ylo@cs.hut.fi> as part of SSH but rewritten.

Wed Jan  8 14:50:47 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in, getopt.h, sighandle.c, system.h: Remove CVSid; we
	decided to get rid of these some time ago.

Thu Jan  2 13:30:56 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in, argmatch.c, fnmatch.c, fnmatch.h, getline.c,
	getopt.c, getopt.h, getopt1.c, getwd.c, hostname.c, mkdir.c,
	regex.c, regex.h, rename.c, sighandle.c, strdup.c, strerror.c,
	stripslash.c, system.h, vasprintf.c, wait.h, xgetwd.c, yesno.c:
	Remove "675" paragraph;	see ../ChangeLog for rationale.

Sun Nov 24 13:34:25 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* getdate.y (Convert): Change last acceptable year from 1999 to
	2038.
	* getdate.c: Regenerated using byacc 1.9.

Tue Nov 19 17:11:17 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in (OBJECTS): Remove strippath.o; we don't use
	strip_path anymore.
	(SOURCES): Remove strippath.c.
	* strippath.c: Removed.
	* build_lib.com: Remove strippath.c.

Wed Oct  2 10:43:35 1996  Norbert Kiesel  <nk@col.sw-ley.de>

	* getdate.y: removed CVSid variable

	* getdate.c: regenerated (using byacc 1.9)

Wed Sep 25 10:25:00 1996  Larry Jones  <larry.jones@sdrc.com>

	* vasprintf.c: Fix type clashes in calls to strtoul.

Wed Sep 11 15:55:31 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* build_lib.com: Add valloc.c.

Tue Sep 10 23:04:34 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in (DISTFILES): Add build_lib.com.

Fri Aug 16 16:01:57 1996  Norbert Kiesel  <nk@col.sw-ley.de>

	* Makefile.in (installdirs): new (empty) target

Mon Aug 12 11:03:43 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* system.h: Don't use #elif.  It is said to cause problems with
	one of the HP compilers on HPUX 9.01.

Sun Jul  7 23:25:46 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* memmove.c: Removed.  The memove function was used by a very old
	version of the CVS server for nefarious purposes and it has been
	long gone.
	* Makefile.in (SOURCES): Remove memmove.c.

Thu Jun  6 15:12:59 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* vasprintf.c: If STDC_HEADERS, include stdlib.h rather than
	declaring its functions ourself.

Wed Jun 05 10:14:29 1996  Mike Ladwig  <mike@twinpeaks.prc.com>
			  and Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@cyclic.com>

	* system.h: If ERRNO_H_MISSING is defined, don't include errno.h.

Wed Jun 05 10:14:29 1996  Mike Ladwig  <mike@twinpeaks.prc.com>

	* regex.c: Don't define MAX and MIN if already defined.

Sun May 12 09:40:08 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* getdate.y: Replace alloca.h include with a comment explaining
	why we avoid alloca and the consequences of that.
	* getdate.c: Regenerated.

Wed May  8 09:31:03 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* getdate.c: Regenerate with the version of byacc in Red Hat 3.0.3
	(which I believe is byacc 1.9).  byacc, unlike bison, does not
	require alloca in the generated parser.

Thu Apr 25 18:26:34 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* getdate.y (get_date): Set Start from nowtime, not now->time,
	which may not be set.
	* getdate.c: Regenerated.

Wed Apr 10 17:55:02 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* getdate.y (get_date): Use a time_t variable rather than a field
	in a struct timeb.  Works around Solaris compiler bug.  Sure, it
	is a compiler bug, but the workaround is completely painless.
	* getdate.c: Regenerated.

Fri Mar 22 11:17:05 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* system.h: If EXIT_FAILURE is not defined by stdlib.h, define it
	ourself.

Thu Mar 14 16:27:53 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* system.h: Remove alloca cruft.

Wed Feb 28 03:16:48 1996  Benjamin J. Lee  <benjamin@cyclic.com>

	* build_lib.com: Changed definition of symbol CC to search
	for include files in [-.VMS] so VMS config.h can be picked
	up without copying.

Tue Feb 27 21:26:34 1996  Benjamin J. Lee  <benjamin@cyclic.com>

	* build_lib.com: Added.  DCL File to build contents of [.lib]

Tue Feb 27 21:18:38 1996  Benjamin J. Lee  <benjamin@cyclic.com>

	* system.h: added an existence_error macro check for EVMSERR
	necessary for happiness under VMS

Thu Feb 22 22:30:04 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in (OBJECTS): Remove @ALLOCA@
	(SOURCES): Remove alloca.c
	* alloca.c: Removed.
	* regex.c (REGEX_MALLOC): Define.

Thu Feb 15 14:00:00  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@cyclic.com>

	* vasprintf.c: Declare abs().

Wed Feb 14 14:48:31 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* vasprintf.c (int_vasprintf): Don't cast arguments to memcpy.
	* vasprintf.c, strtoul.c: Don't include ansidecl.h.  Do include
	config.h if HAVE_CONFIG_H (for const).
	* strtoul.c: Change CONST to const.

Tue Feb 13 20:04:39 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* strtoul.c: Added (needed by vasprintf.c, and missing on SunOS4).
	* Makefile.in (SOURCES): Add strtoul.c.

Mon Feb 12 10:04:46 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* vasprintf.c: Added (same contents as before).
	* Makefile.in (SOURCES): Add vasprintf.c.

Thu Feb  1 14:33:17 1996  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.red-bean.com>

        * Makefile.in (xlint): new rule; does nothing, as I'm not sure
        running lint is actually advisable in here, but the top-level
        Makefile thinks it can `make xlint' here.

Thu Feb  1 15:07:42 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* getopt.c: Remove rcsid.

Tue Jan 30 18:20:27 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* getline.c: Don't define NDEBUG.
	(getstr): Rewrite assertions in a way which should stay clear of
	signed/unsigned problems and compiler warnings thereof.

Thu Jan 25 00:14:06 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@beezley.cyclic.com>

Wed Jan  3 18:16:50 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* sighandle.c (SIG_register): Use memset not bzero.
	* system.h: Remove defines for index, rindex, bcmp, and bzero.
	All the calls to those functions are gone from CVS.

Tue Jan  2 13:00:00 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@peary.cyclic.com>

	Visual C++ lint:
	* sighandle.c: Prototype SIG_handle and SIG_defaults.
	Use SIG_ERR where appropriate.

Mon Dec 18 10:15:05 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* rename.c: Check ENOENT rather than existence_error.  The latter
	is undefined in this file, and including system.h is said to cause
	(unspecified) problems.

Sun Dec 17 23:58:06 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* vasprintf.c: Removed (it is no longer used).
	* Makefile.in (SOURCES): Remove vasprintf.c.

Sat Dec 16 17:18:33 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* vasprintf.c: Added.
	* Makefile.in (SOURCES): Add vasprintf.c

Mon Dec  4 10:54:04 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* getdate.c: Remove #line directives.  I know, this is a kludge,
	but Visual C++ 2.1 seems to require it (why, I have no idea.  It
	has no trouble with the #line directives in getdate in CVS 1.6).

Sat Nov 18 16:20:37 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * rename.c: same.

        * mkdir.c: Use new macro `existence_error', instead of comparing
        errno to ENOENT directly.

        * system.h (existence_error): new macro, tries to portably ask if
        errno represents a file-not-exist error.

Fri Nov 17 20:08:58 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * system.h (NEED_DECOY_PERMISSIONS): moved this section to where
        it belongs, duh.

        * getdate.c: if STDC_HEADERS, then just include <stdlib.h> instead
        of declaring malloc() and realloc() to be char *.

        * system.h: ifdef NEED_DECOY_PERMISSIONS, then define the S_I*
        permission masks for USR, GRP, and OTH in terms of the simpler
        OS/2 masks.

Wed Nov 15 15:36:03 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * system.h: ifdef USE_OWN_TCPIP_H, then include "tcpip.h".  Only
        OS/2 does this right now.

Tue Nov 14 18:44:57 1995  Greg A. Woods  <woods@most.weird.com>

	* getdate.c: OK, this one is from SunOS-4.1 yacc and may be more
	portable -- at least it compiles silently here!  ;-)

Mon Nov 13 03:53:45 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * fnmatch.c: conform to 80 column standard (yes, I'm a pedant).

Wed Nov  8 11:10:59 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * system.h (STAT_MACROS): ifdef S_IFMT, then use it as before; but
        if it's not defined, then just do a single mask and assume
        acceptance any of non-zero result.  Norbert, I trust you'll let me
        know if this is unsatisfactory. :-)
        Ifdef HAVE_SYS_UTIME_H, then include <sys/utime.h>.  Only OS/2
        defines this right now.

Wed Nov  8 13:18:51 1995  Norbert Kiesel  <nk@col.sw-ley.de>

	* valloc.c: omit malloc declaration (it's already in system.h
	  which is included and conflicts with <stdlib.h> on some
	  systems).

Tue Nov  7 19:38:48 1995  Norbert Kiesel  <nk@col.sw-ley.de>

	* system.h (STAT_MACROS_BROKEN): undo previous change, because
	  else all regular files will be identified as links (the mask for
	  links is S_IFREG|S_IFCHR).

Mon Nov  6 19:20:56 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * system.h (STAT_MACROS_BROKEN): in defining the S_IF* macros,
        don't fold to 1 or 0 by first masking with S_IFMT; not all
        systems have that macro, and anyway it's only necessary that we
        return non-zero.

Fri Oct 27 13:43:35 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * save-cwd.c: use __PROTO instead of __P (see below).

        * getline.h (__PROTO): same as below.

        * save-cwd.h (__PROTO): replaces __P.  New name, so don't ask if
        already defined.  The conflict was that OS/2 w/ IBM C/C++ uses
        `__P' for something else, in <ctype.h> of all places.

        * system.h: do nothing about alloca ifdef ALLOCA_IN_STDLIB (see
        ../src/ChangeLog).

Tue Oct 24 13:01:25 1995  Norbert Kiesel  <nk@col.sw-ley.de>

	* wait.h: include sys/resource.h if available. This is needed at
	  least under AIX-3.2 where <sys/wait.h> doesn't include it.

Mon Oct 23 17:39:11 1995  Norbert Kiesel  <nk@col.sw-ley.de>

	* valloc.c (valloc): change parameter definition

Sun Oct 22 14:15:44 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* getline.c, getline.h: New files.
	* Makefile.in (SOURCES, OBJECTS, HEADERS): Add getline.c, getline.o,
	and getline.h, respectively.

Tue Oct 10 18:01:50 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@totoro.cyclic.com>

        * Makefile.in (cvs_srcdir): define cvs_srcdir to be ../src, then
        include it with -I so save_cwd.c can find error.h (for example).

Sun Oct  8 12:27:57 1995  Peter Wemm  <peter@haywire.DIALix.COM>

	* system.h: define POSIX_SIGNALS or BSD_SIGNALS if configure has
	located all the necessary functions for each "type".
	* sighandle.c: detect/use POSIX/BSD reliable signals (especially
	for blocking signals in critical sections).  Helps prevent stray
	locks on interruption.

Mon Oct  2 18:11:23 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* system.h: Doc fix.

Mon Oct  2 18:10:35 1995  Larry Jones  <larry.jones@sdrc.com>

	* regex.c: compile 4.2 BSD compatible functions even when
	_POSIX_SOURCE is defined since we need them and we wouldn't be
	compiling this file unless they don't exist.

Mon Oct  2 10:32:20 1995  Michael Finken  <finken@conware.de>

        * strstr.c (strstr): new file and func.

        * Makefile.in (SOURCES): added strstr.c.

Sun Oct  1 21:03:40 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@totoro.cyclic.com>

        * regex.c: reverted below change.

Thu Sep 28 13:37:04 1995  Larry Jones <larry.jones@sdrc.com>

        * regexp.c: check for ISC.

Thu Sep 7  19:18:00 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@cyclic.com>

	* save-cwd.c: #include <direct.h> and <io.h>, on systems that
	have them.

	* getopt.c (_getopt_internal): Cast the return value of strlen,
	which is unsigned, before comparing it with the difference between
	two pointers, which is unsigned.

Thu Aug 31 11:31:42 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* getdate.y [STDC_HEADERS]: #include <stdlib.h>, for abort.
	[HAVE_ALLOCA_H]: #include <alloca.h>, for alloca on Windows NT.

Wed Aug 30 18:48:44 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* system.h [HAVE_IO_H]: #include <io.h>, for Windows NT.
	[HAVE_DIRECT_H]: #include <direct.h>, for Windows NT.
	(CVS_MKDIR, FOLD_FN_CHAR, fnfold, fncmp, ISDIRSEP, OPEN_BINARY,
	FOPEN_BINARY_READ, FOPEN_BINARY_WRITE): New macros/functions, for
	use in system-sensitive code.

	* regex.c (re_set_registers): start and end are pointers, not
	integers.  Cast the initializing value appropriately.

	* getopt.c [HAVE_STRING_H]: #include <string.h>, to avoid
	warnings.

	* fnmatch.c (FOLD_FN_CHAR): Give this a dummy #definition if
	config.h didn't #define it.
        (fnmatch): Pass filename characters through FOLD_FN_CHAR before
	comparing them.

	* argmatch.c: #include <sys/types.h>.
	(argmatch): Declare arglen to be a size_t, rather than an int,
	to avoid signed/unsigned comparison "problems".

	* .cvsignore: Remove getdate.c from this file.  We want to
	distribute it, for systems that don't have a Yacc-equivalent
	installed (like Windows NT).

Sat Aug 19 22:00:51 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* error.c: Don't #define CVS_SUPPORT here.  config.h takes care of
	that for us.
	[CVS_SUPPORT] (error_use_protocol): New variable, with apology.
	(error): If error_use_protocol is set, report errors using the
	client/server protocol.
	* error.h [CVS_SUPPORT]: Extern decl for error_use_protocol.

Fri Aug  4 00:01:24 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* xgetwd.c: Don't declare free.  A K&R style declaration gets
	a conflict on some Sun systems when compiling with acc.

	* save-cwd.c: New file.
	* save-cwd.h: New file.
	* Makefile.in (SOURCES): Add save-cwd.c
	(OBJECTS): Add save-cwd.o.
	(HEADERS): Add save-cwd.h.

Thu Aug  3 00:55:54 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

Thu Jul 27 09:11:41 1995  Robert Lipe <robertl@rjlhome.arnet.com>

	* system.h: Check for PATHSIZE before falling back to _POSIX_PATH_MAX.

Thu Jul 20 12:38:03 1995  James Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* error.c: Instead of calling cvs functions to clean up, allow cvs
	to register a callback via error_set_cleanup.  Avoids hassles with
	include files and SERVER_SUPPORT and so on.

Tue Jul 18 21:18:00 1995  Jim Blandy <jimb@cyclic.com>

	* system.h: Include <sys/param.h> only if HAVE_SYS_PARAM_H
	is #defined.  We've added a test to configure.in to #define this
	on most systems.

Thu Jul 13 11:22:21 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* xgetwd.c: New file.
	* Makefile.in (SOURCES): Add xgetwd.c
	(OBJECTS): Add xgetwd.o.

Wed Jul 12 09:18:49 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* Makefile.in (OBJECTS): Remove fnmatch.o.  Now configure adds it
	to LIBOBJS when necessary.

Fri Jun 30 16:27:18 1995  James Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* rename.c (rename): If MVDIR is not defined, just give an error
	on attempt to rename a directory.

Thu Jun 29 00:46:31 1995  James Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* system.h: Check HAVE_SYS_TIMEB_H not non-existent HAVE_TIMEB_H.

	* system.h: Don't define alloca if it is already defined.

Wed Jun 28 15:24:51 1995  James Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* system.h: If NeXT, define utimbuf ourself.

Mon May 29 22:32:40 1995  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@rtl.cygnus.com>

	* system.h: Handle time and directory headers as recommended in
	the autoconf manual.
	Undefine the S_FOO() macros if STAT_MACROS_BROKEN is set.
	Don't define mode_t, as it is handled by config.h.

Sat May 27 08:46:00 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* Makefile.in (Makefile): Regenerate only Makefile in current
	directory when Makefile.in is out of date.  Depend on ../config.status.

Fri Apr 28 22:49:25 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.bio.indiana.edu>

	* Makefile.in (SOURCES, OBJECTS): Updated.
	(HEADERS): New variable.
	(DISTFILES): Updated.
	(dist-dir): Renamed from dist; changed to work with DISTDIR
	variable passed from parent.

Wed Feb  8 06:37:53 1995  Roland McGrath  <roland@churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* system.h (S_IRUSR et al): Define if not already defined.

	* waitpid.c [HAVE_CONFIG_H]: Include "config.h".
	(ualloc): Return OLDPTR rather than running off the end.

Mon Aug 22 22:48:19 1994  Ken Raeburn  (raeburn@kr-pc.cygnus.com)

	* error.c (strerror): Replaced conditional static definition
	(always used, since the condition variable was never set) with an
	extern declaration, since it's provided by libc or strerror.c.

Wed Aug 10 14:54:25 1994  Ken Raeburn  (raeburn@cujo.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in (SOURCES): Add waitpid.c.
	* waitpid.c: New file.

Tue Aug  9 16:00:12 1994  Ken Raeburn  (raeburn@cujo.cygnus.com)

	* md5.h (uint32): If SIZEOF_LONG isn't 4, don't define this to be
	"unsigned long"; try SIZEOF_INT and "unsigned int", otherwise
	complain.

	* md5.c: Include config.h.
	(const): Don't bother defining here, config.h should take care of
	it.

	* valloc.c (malloc): Declare.

Fri Jul 15 12:57:20 1994  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@sanguine.cygnus.com)

	* getopt.c: Do not include <stdlib.h> unless __GNU_LIBRARY__ is
	defined.  On Irix 5.2, <stdlib.h> includes <getopt.h>, which
	causes a multiple definition of struct option.

Fri Jul  8 10:04:59 1994  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* md5.h, md5.c: Remove ANSI-isms.

Thu Jul  7 20:24:18 1994  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@sanguine.cygnus.com)

	* md5.h, md5.c: New files.
	* Makefile.in (SOURCES): Add md5.c.
	(OBJECTS): Add md5.o.
	(DISTFILES): Add md5.h.
	(md5.o): New target; depend upon md5.h.

Fri May 27 18:15:34 1994  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@tweedledumb.cygnus.com)

	* valloc.c: New file.

Tue May 17 08:18:26 1994  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* error.c (error, fperror): If server_active, call server_cleanup
	as well as Lock_Cleanup.

	* system.h: Fix Dec 27 change to work correctly.  Makes Sep 9
	change unnecessary, so backed that one out.  Never define PATH_MAX
	in terms of pathconf, because that doesn't produce a constant, and
	PATH_MAX is used to set array sizes.

	* system.h: don't touch PATH_MAX or MAXPATHLEN if *both* of them
	are already defined, as one may be defined in terms of the other.
