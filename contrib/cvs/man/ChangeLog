Mon Jan 12 11:10:21 1998  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.1: Refer to Cederqvist as Cederqvist not as cvs.texinfo.
	Describe it in a way which hopefully makes more sense for people
	who aren't getting the CVS source distribution itself.  In "SEE
	ALSO" section, also mention web pages.  Use a period not a comma
	at the end of the references to other manpages.

Tue Oct  1 14:01:28 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.1: Revert all changes by Greg Woods since CVS 1.8.86.  They

Fri Sep 13 11:01:59 1996  Greg A. Woods  <woods@clapton.seachange.com>

	import allows '-b 1' to import to the trunk.

Tue May 14 10:23:59 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.1: Add cvs.texinfo to the SEE ALSO section.  Replace an out
	of date list of default ignore patterns with a reference to
	cvs.texinfo (if someone wants to undo this change that is OK with
	me but I did it this way because it isn't clear people would
	actually keep cvs.1 up to date).

Wed Mar 13 17:06:39 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvsinit.8: Removed.
	* Makefile.in, cvs.1, cvs.5: Remove references to cvsinit.

	- list filenames in alpha sort order
	- describe the cvswrappers file
	- describe the taginfo file
	- fix cvsinit chapter number
	(This is by no means complete -- it's just stuff I noticed.)

	* cvs.1: put the filenames in alpha sort order

	* cvsinit.8: remove the .pl extension from filenames

Wed Oct 18 11:07:07 1995  Vince Demarco  <vdemarco@bou.shl.com>

	* cvs.1 (Flag): Updated the CVSROOT/wrappers stuff. Everyone seems
        to think this is a NEXT specific thing it isn't.

Tue Oct 17 17:38:27 1995  Warren Jones  <wjones@tc.fluke.com>

	* cvs.1: Change \. to \&. at start of line.

Tue Oct  3 13:43:33 1995  Del  <del@matra.com.au>

	* cvs.1: Updated man page for all the new features of 1.6
	(including some that were missed in 1.5 and 1.4.xx).  This includes:
	- -f and -z global options.
	- tag -F, and -r options.
	- rtag -F options
	- CVSROOT/taginfo and CVSROOT/wrappers files (the latter could use a touch
	  up because I don't really understand how wrappers work or why anyone would
	  use them -- I haven't ever played with a NEXT.
	- export -k option
	- New environment variables CVS_IGNORE_REMOTE_ROOT, CVS_RSH, CVS_SERVER, and
	  CVSWRAPPERS.  I left CVS_CLIENT_LOG, CVS_CLIENT_PORT, and CVS_SERVER_SLEEP
	  undocumented because these appear to be for testing / debugging only.
	  Note that TMPDIR, HOME and PATH are used as well and strictly speaking
	  should be documented.
	- New files ~/.cvsrc and ~/.cvswrappers

Tue Aug 15 08:13:14 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * Makefile.in (MANFILES): include $MAN8FILES too, so they get
        tarred up in the distribution just like anything else.

Mon Jul 24 19:11:15 1995  James Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.1: Remove references to -q and -Q command options.

        and cvsinit pages (from previous local changes)

	* Makefile.in (Makefile): Regenerate only Makefile in current
