2001-09-06  Larry Jones  <larry.jones@sdrc.com>
            for Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Sync with revision 1.48 of the GNU Emacs sources.  This
	incorporates the following changes:

	* rcs2log (Help, mainline code): Add new option -L FILE.
	(Copyright): Update year.

	(LANG, LANGUAGE, LC_ALL, LC_COLLATE, LC_CTYPE, LC_MESSAGES,
	LC_NUMERIC, LC_TIME): New shell vars, to make sure we live in the C locale.

	(mainline code): Handle nonstandard -u option differently, by
	transforming it to standard form.  Check for "Working file: ", not
	"Working file:".  Allow file names with spaces.

	(SOH, rlogfile): New shell vars.
	(rlogout): Remove.  Its old functionality is mostly migrated to rlogfile.

	Append ';;' to the last arm of every case statement, for portability to
	ancient broken BSD shells.

	(logins): Fix bug; was not being computed at all, lowering performance.

	(pository): New var.  This fixes some bugs where repositories are
	remote, or have trailing slashes.

	(authors): $llogout is never an empty shell var, so don't worry about that
	possibility.

	(printlogline, mainline code): Fix bug with SOH's being put into the output.


	2001-07-20  Gerd Moellmann  <gerd@gnu.org>

	* rcs2log: Update copyright notice.


	2001-01-03  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* rcs2log: Avoid security hole allowing attacker to
	cause user of rcs2log to overwrite arbitrary files, fixing
	a bug reported by Morten Welinder.

	Don't put "exit 1" at the end of the exit trap; it's
	ineffective in POSIX shells.

2001-09-04  Derek Price  <dprice@collab.net>

	* Makefile.in: Regenerated with automake 1.5.

2001-08-21  Larry Jones  <larry.jones@sdrc.com>

	from autoconf.

2000-02-25  Larry Jones  <larry.jones@sdr.com>

	so that client/server works correctly.
	* loc_accum.pl: Ditto.

2000-01-24  K.J. Paradise <kj@sourcegear.com>

	* sccs2rcs.csh: fixed a y2k bug.  This was submitted 
	by Ceri Davies <ceri_davies@isdcorp.com>, and looks 
	okay to me. 

1999-01-19  Graham Stoney <greyham@research.canon.com.au>

	* log.pl: The author commited the canonical perl "localtime" Y2K
	offence, of printing "19$year" instead of (1900 + $year). Of
	course, the result is non-compliance in year 2000.  Fix it.

1998-10-14  Jim Kingdon

	* ccvs-rsh.pl: Removed; it was not in DISTFILES so it didn't
	actually get distributed.  I'm going to move it to the web on the
	theory that the web is a better place for such things.
	* README: Don't mention it.

	* Makefile.in (dist-dir, distclean): Remove references to elib.
	* elib: Remove this subdirectory and all its contents.  It went
	with pcl-cvs, which is no longer distributed with CVS.

1998-09-22  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* pvcs_to_rcs: Removed; it was not in DISTFILES so it didn't
	actually get distributed.  I'm going to move it to the web on the
	theory that the web is a better place for such things.
	* README: Don't mention it.

1998-09-10  Jim Kingdon

	Check in Paul Eggert <eggert@twinsun.com>'s submission of
	1998-08-15.  I also ran "cvs admin -ko" on this file so that his
	version number would be intact (not an ideal solution, because
	people will import it into other repositories, but I don't feel
	like hacking the master version).
	* rcs2log.sh: Sync with master version at gnu.org.

1998-08-15  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* README: Don't mention listener, since it was removed a while
	ago.
	* listen2.c, listen2.mak: Removed; because there is no easy way to
	pass a socket (as opposed to file descriptor) from one process to
	another on Windows, this isn't a promising approach (at least not
	in this form).
	* Makefile.in (DISTFILES): Remove them.
	* .cvsignore: Remove listen2.ncb listen2.mdp Debug.

1998-05-11  W. Bradley Rubenstein

	* log.pl: Check for errors from open and exec.

Sat Feb 21 21:59:45 1998  Ian Lance Taylor  <ian@cygnus.com>

	* Makefile.in (clean): Change "/bin/rm" to "rm".

Thu Aug  7 22:42:23 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* pvcs_to_rcs: Remove RCS keywords.  Remove $Log and move the data
	to this ChangeLog (below).  Add paragraph that David Martin
	emailed along with the script.

	    Revision 1.6  1997/03/07 16:21:28  divad
	    Need to explicitly state archive name in PVCS get command for
 	    those cases where the case of the workfile and the case of the
 	    archive file are different (OS/2)

	    Revision 1.5  1997/03/07 00:31:04  divad
	    Added capitalized extensions and framemaker files as binaries;
 	    also overriding any path specification for workfiles at PVCS
 	    checkout (most annoying).

	    Revision 1.4  1997/03/06 21:04:55  divad
	    Added \n to the end of each comment line to prevent multi-line
 	    comments for a single revision from "merging"

	    Revision 1.3  1997/03/06 19:50:25  divad
	    Corrected bug in binary extensions; correcting processing
 	    comment strings with double quotes

	    Revision 1.2  1997/03/06 17:29:10  divad
	    Provided list of extensions (rather than using Unix file
 	    command) to determine which files are binary; also printing
 	    version label as they are applied

	    Revision 1.1  1997/02/26 00:04:29  divad
	    Perl script to convert pvcs archives to rcs archives

	* README: mention pvcs_to_rcs.
	* pvcs_to_rcs: New file.  This is the file as I got it from David
	Martin.  Will be checking in the tweaks shortly.

17 May 1997  Jim Kingdon

	* listen2.c: Failed attempt at making this do what it was
	intended to do.  Will need to rethink the approach.
	* listen2.mak: The usual involuntary tweaks.
	* .cvsignore: Add listen2.ncb listen2.mdp.

Mon May 12 11:59:23 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* listener.c: Removed; see ../ChangeLog for rationale.

10 May 1997  Jim Kingdon

	* listen2.c, listen2.mak: New files.
	* Makefile.in (DISTFILES): Add them.
	* .cvsignore: Add Debug.

Thu Feb 20 22:43:45 1997  David J MacKenzie  <djm@va.pubnix.com>

	* rcs-to-cvs.sh: Put temporary files in /var/tmp or /usr/tmp
	whichever one exists.  Just call "vi" not "/usr/ucb/vi".

Mon Feb 17 08:51:37 1997  Greg A. Woods  <woods@most.weird.com>

	* .cvsignore: added 'cvs2vendor' target from Feb. 12 changes.

	* log_accum.pl (build_header): added "Repository:" to the report
	header to show the first argument supplied to the script by CVS.
	[[this value seems spuriously to be wrong when client is used]]
	($hostdomain): correct order of initialization from the Feb. 12
	changes.
	($modulename): add more commentary about using '-M' to to get a
	meaningful string here.
	Tweak a few other comments from the Feb. 12 changes.

Wed Feb 12 10:27:48 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cln_hist.pl, commit_prep.pl, cvs2vendor.sh, cvs_acls.pl,
	cvscheck.man, cvscheck.sh, cvshelp.man, descend.man, descend.sh,
	log_accum.pl, mfpipe.pl, rcs-to-cvs.sh, rcs2log.sh, rcs2sccs.sh,
	sccs2rcs.csh: Remove $Id; we decided to get rid of these some
	time ago.

Wed Feb 12 00:24:33 1997  Greg A. Woods  <woods@most.weird.com>

	* cvs2vendor.sh: new script.
	* README: noted new cvs2vendor script.
	* Makefile.in (DISTFILES): added cvs2vendor.sh.
	(CONTRIB_PROGS): added cvs2vendor.

	* log_accum.pl (show_wd): new variable, initialized to 0.
	- set $show_wd if '-w' option found while parsing @ARGV.
	- don't add 'In directory' line to report header unless $show_wd
	is set.
	(domainname): prepend a leading '.' if none there so that
	concatenation with $hostname works (those with a FQDN hostname
	*and* a domainname still lose).
	(mail_notification): don't set a "From:" header -- the mailer will.

Wed Jan  8 14:48:58 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in, README, log.pl: Remove CVSid; we decided to get rid
	of these some time ago.

Thu Jan  2 13:30:56 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in: Remove "675" paragraph; see ../ChangeLog for rationale.

Thu Oct 17 18:28:25 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* patch-2.1-.new-fix: Removed; it was not in DISTFILES so it never
	made it into distributions.  It also isn't clear what it has to do
	with CVS.  It is available from
	    ftp://ftp.weird.com/pub/patch-2.1-.new-fix
	* README: Remove entry for patch-2.1-.new-fix.

Wed Oct 16 10:22:44 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* rcs2log.sh: Change date output format to something CVS 1.9
 	accepts.  I think this breaks the Sep 29 change, but I don't have
 	a copy of CVS 1.5 handy, so I can't find a format that works with
 	both, and I think it's more important that it work with the
 	version it's distributed with.

Sat Oct 12 21:18:19 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* README: Don't mention pcl-cvs; it isn't here any more.

Sun Sep 29 19:45:19 1996  Greg A. Woods  <woods@most.weird.com>

	* README: add entry for patch-2.1-.new-fix.
	
	* README: re-write the top section a bit.

	* patch-2.1-.new-fix: re-generated using fixed "cvs patch" command.

	* patch-2.1-.new-fix: new file.

Sun Sep 29 14:25:28 1996  Dave Love  <d.love@dl.ac.uk>

	* rcs2log.sh (month_data):  Make default date format acceptable to
 	CVS post v1.8 as well as earlier CVSs and RCS.
	Message-Id: <199609291546.QAA25531@mserv1.dl.ac.uk>
	To: bug-gnu-emacs@prep.ai.mit.edu

Thu Aug 29 11:58:03 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* rcs2log: Update FSF address.

	* rcs2log: Be more aggressive about finding the author's full
	name; try nismatch and ypmatch.

	* rcs2log: If the hostname appears not to be fully qualified, see
 	if domainname provides any useful information.

Fri Aug 16 16:02:36 1996  Norbert Kiesel  <nk@col.sw-ley.de>

	* Makefile.in (installdirs): support this target

Mon May  6 13:04:57 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in (install): Don't tell user to run cvsinit.  It isn't
	called cvsinit anymore, and it isn't necessary (repositories are,
	and need to be, compatible between cvs versions).

Sun Apr 14 11:30:36 1996  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.red-bean.com>

	* Makefile.in (.pl, .csh): *Never* redirect output directly to
	the target (usu $@) of a rule.  Instead, redirect to a temporary
	file, and then move that temporary to the target.  I chose to

	of the temporary file name not exceed the 14-character limit.
