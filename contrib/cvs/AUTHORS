Authors of GNU CVS

The conflict-resolution algorithms and much of the administrative file
definitions of CVS were based on the original package written by Dick Grune
at Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam <dick@cs.vu.nl>, and posted to
comp.sources.unix in the volume 6 release sometime in 1986.  This original
version was a collection of shell scripts.  I am thankful that Dick made
his work available.

Brian Berliner from Prisma, Inc. (now at Sun Microsystems, Inc.)
<berliner@sun.com> converted the original CVS shell scripts into reasonably
fast C and added many, many features to support software release control
functions.  See the manual page in the "man" directory.  A copy of the
USENIX article presented at the Winter 1990 USENIX Conference, Washington
D.C., is included in the "doc" directory.

Jeff Polk from BSDI <polk@bsdi.com> converted the CVS 1.2
sources into much more readable and maintainable C code.  He also added a
whole lot of functionality and modularity to the code in the process.
See the bottom of the NEWS file (from about 1992).

david d `zoo' zuhn <zoo@armadillo.com> contributed the working base code
for CVS 1.4 Alpha.  His work carries on from work done by K. Richard Pixley
and others at Cygnus Support.  The CVS 1.4 upgrade is due in large part to
Zoo's efforts.

David G. Grubbs <dgg@odi.com> contributed the CVS "history" and "release"
commands.  As well as the ever-so-useful "-n" option of CVS which tells CVS
to show what it would do, without actually doing it.  He also contributed
support for the .cvsignore file.

The Free Software Foundation (GNU) contributed most of the portability
framework that CVS now uses.  This can be found in the "configure" script,
the Makefile's, and basically most of the "lib" directory.

K. Richard Pixley, Cygnus Support <rich@cygnus.com> contributed many bug
fixes/enhancement as well as completing early reviews of the CVS 1.3 manual
pages.

Roland Pesch, then of Cygnus Support <roland@wrs.com> contributed
brand new cvs(1) and cvs(5) manual pages.  Thanks to him for saving us
from poor use of our language!

Paul Sander, HaL Computer Systems, Inc. <paul@hal.com> wrote and
contributed the code in lib/sighandle.c.  I added support for POSIX, BSD,
and non-POSIX/non-BSD systems.

Jim Kingdon and others at Cygnus Support <info@cygnus.com> wrote the
remote repository access code.

Larry Jones and Derek Price <derek@ximbiot.com> have been maintaining and
enhancing CVS for some years.  Mark D. Baushke <mdb@gnu.org> came on in
2003.

Conrad Pino <Conrad@Pino.com> began maintaining the Windows port in 2004.

There have been many, many contributions not listed here.  Consult the
individual ChangeLog files in each directory for a more complete idea.

Many contributors have added code to the "contrib" directory.  See the
README file there for a list of what is available.  There is also a
contributed GNU Emacs CVS-mode in tools/pcl-cvs.
