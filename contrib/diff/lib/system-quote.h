#ifndef _SYSTEM_QUOTE_H
#define _SYSTEM_QUOTE_H

/* When passing a command the system's command interpreter, we must quote the
   program name and arguments, since
     - Unix shells interpret characters like " ", "'", "<", ">", "$", '*', '?'
       etc. in a special way,
     - Windows CreateProcess() interprets characters like ' ', '\t', '\\', '"'
       etc. (but not '<' and '>') in a special way,
     - Windows cmd.exe also interprets characters like '<', '>', '&', '%', etc.
       in a special way.  Note that it is impossible to pass arguments that
       contain newlines or carriage return characters to programs through
       cmd.exe.
     - Windows programs usually perform wildcard expansion when they receive
       arguments that contain unquoted '*', '?' characters.

  With this module, you can build a command that will invoke a program with
  specific strings as arguments.

  Note: If you want wildcard expansion to happen, you have to first do wildcard
  expansion through the 'glob' module, then quote the resulting strings through
  this module, and then invoke the system's command interpreter.

  Limitations:
    - When invoking native Windows programs on Windows Vista or newer,
      wildcard expansion will occur in the invoked program nevertheless.
    - On native Windows, for SCI_SYSTEM and SCI_WINDOWS_CMD, newlines and
      carriage return characters are not supported.  Their undesired effect
      is to truncate the entire command line.
