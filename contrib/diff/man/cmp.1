SKIP1 and SKIP2 are the number of bytes to skip in each file.
SKIP values may be followed by the following multiplicative suffixes:
kB 1000, K 1024, MB 1,000,000, M 1,048,576,
GB 1,000,000,000, G 1,073,741,824, and so on for T, P, E, Z, Y.
.PP
If a FILE is `\-' or missing, read standard input.
Exit status is 0 if inputs are the same, 1 if different, 2 if trouble.
