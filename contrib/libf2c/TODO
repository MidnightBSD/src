TODO list for the g77 library

* Investigate building shared libraries on systems we know about
  (probably using libtool).

* Better test cases.

* Allow the library to be stripped to save space.  (The install-strip
  makefile target now allows this, should it be easily invocable.)

* An interface to IEEE maths functions from libc where this makes
  sense.
