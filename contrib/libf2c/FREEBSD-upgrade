For the import of lib{f,g}2c, files were pruned by:

	tar xvypf gcc-2.95.2.tar.bz2 '*/libf2c'

Then imported by:

	cvs import -m "Virgin import of GCC 2.95.2's libf2c"  \
		src/contrib/libf2c FSF gcc_2_95_2


To make local changes to lib{f,g}2c, simply patch and commit to the main
branch (aka HEAD).  Never make local changes on the vendor (FSF) branch.

All local changes should be submitted to "gcc-patches@gcc.gnu.org" and/or
David M. Gay <dmg@bell-labs.com> (as libg2c is based on AT&T's netlib
collection).
