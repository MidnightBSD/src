$FreeBSD$

The FreeBSD copy of libc++.  This contains everything from the include and 
source directories upstream, with the exception of the support/win32 directory, 
which is only required for building on Windows (FreeBSD is not Windows).

To update, bring in anything new in source or include that is not
platform-dependent (unless the platform in question is FreeBSD, obviously).
