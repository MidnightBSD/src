Security Fixes

9.6.2-P3

     * Adding a NO DATA signed negative response to cache failed to clear
       any matching RRSIG records already in cache. A subsequent lookup of
       the cached NO DATA entry could crash named (INSIST) when the
       unexpected RRSIG was also returned with the NO DATA cache entry.
       [RT #22288] [CVE-2010-3613] [VU#706148]
     * BIND, acting as a DNSSEC validator, was determining if the NS RRset
       is insecure based on a value that could mean either that the RRset
       is actually insecure or that there wasn't a matching key for the
       RRSIG in the DNSKEY RRset when resuming from validating the DNSKEY
       RRset. This can happen when in the middle of a DNSKEY algorithm
       rollover, when two different algorithms were used to sign a zone
       but only the new set of keys are in the zone DNSKEY RRset. [RT
       #22309] [CVE-2010-3614] [VU#837744]

Bug Fixes

9.6.2-P3

     * Worked around a race condition in the cache database memory
       handling. Without this fix a DNS cache DB or ADB could incorrectly
       stay in an over memory state, effectively refusing further caching,
       which subsequently made a BIND 9 caching server unworkable. [RT
       #21818]
     * Microsoft changed the behavior of sockets between NT/XP based
       stacks vs Vista/windows7 stacks. Server 2003/2008 have the older
       behavior, 2008r2 has the new behavior. With the change, different
       error results are possible, so ISC adapted BIND to handle the new
       error results. This resolves an issue where sockets would shut down
       on Windows servers causing named to stop responding to queries. [RT
       #21906]
     * Windows has non-POSIX compliant behavior in its rename() and
       unlink() calls. This caused journal compaction to fail on Windows
       BIND servers with the log error: "dns_journal_compact failed:
       failure". [RT #22434]
