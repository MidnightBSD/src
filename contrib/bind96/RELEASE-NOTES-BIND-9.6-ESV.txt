New Features

9.6-ESV-R5

     * Added a tool able to generate malformed packets to allow testing of
       how named handles them. [RT #24096]

Security Fixes

9.6-ESV-R5

     * named, set up to be a caching resolver, is vulnerable to a user
       querying a domain with very large resource record sets (RRSets)
       when trying to negatively cache the response. Due to an off-by-one
       error, caching the response could cause named to crash. [RT #24650]
       [CVE-2011-1910]
     * Change #2912 populated the message section in replies to UPDATE
       requests, which some Windows clients wanted. This exposed a latent
       bug that allowed the response message to crash named. With this
       fix, change 2912 has been reduced to copy only the zone section to
       the reply. A more complete fix for the latent bug will be released
       later. [RT #24777]

Feature Changes

9.6-ESV-R5

     * Merged in the NetBSD ATF test framework (currently version 0.12)
       for development of future unit tests. Use configure --with-atf to
       build ATF internally or configure --with-atf=prefix to use an
       external copy. [RT #23209]
     * Added more verbose error reporting from DLZ LDAP. [RT #23402]
     * Replaced compile time constant with STDTIME_ON_32BITS. [RT #23587]

Bug Fixes

9.6-ESV-R5

     * During RFC5011 processing some journal write errors were not
       detected. This could lead to managed-keys changes being committed
       but not recorded in the journal files, causing potential
       inconsistencies during later processing. [RT #20256]
       A potential NULL pointer deference in the DNS64 code could cause
       named to terminate unexpectedly. [RT #20256]
       A state variable relating to DNSSEC could fail to be set during
       some infrequently-executed code paths, allowing it to be used
       whilst in an unitialized state during cache updates, with
       unpredictable results. [RT #20256]
       A potential NULL pointer deference in DNSSEC signing code could
       cause named to terminate unexpectedly [RT #20256]
       Several cosmetic code changes were made to silence warnings
       generated by a static code analysis tool. [RT #20256]
     * When using _builtin in named.conf, named.conf changes were not
       found when reloading the config file. Now checks _builtin zone
       arguments to see if the zone is re-usable or not. [RT #21914]
     * After an external code review, a code cleanup was done. [RT #22521]
     * When signing records, named didn't filter out any TTL changes to
       DNSKEY records. This resulted in an incomplete key set. TTL changes
       are now dealt with before signing. [RT #22590]
     * The IN6_IS_ADDR_LINKLOCAL and IN6_IS_ADDR_SITELOCAL macros in win32
       were updated/corrected per current Windows OS. [RT #22724]
     * Cause named to terminate at startup or rndc reconfig reload to
       fail, if a log file specified in the conf file isn't a plain file.
       (RT #22771]
     * named now forces the ADB cache time for glue related data to zero
       instead of relying on TTL. This corrects problematic behavior in
       cases where a server was authoritative for the A record of a
       nameserver for a delegated zone and was queried to recursively
       resolve records within that zone. [RT #22842]
     * Fix the zonechecks system test to fail on error (warning in 9.6,
       fatal in 9.7) to match behaviour for 9.4. [RT #22905]
     * The "rndc" command usage statement was missing the "-b" option. [RT
       #22937]
     * Fixed a possible deadlock due to zone re-signing. [RT #22964]
     * Fixed precedence order bug with NS and DNAME records if both are
       present. (Also fixed timing of autosign test in 9.7+) [RT #23035]
     * The secure zone update feature in named is based on the zone being
       signed and configured for dynamic updates. A bug in the ACL
       processing for "allow-update { none; };" resulted in a zone that is
       supposed to be static being treated as a dynamic zone. Thus, named
       would try to sign/re-sign that zone erroneously. [RT #23120]
     * A new test has been added to check the apex NSEC3 records after
       DNSKEY records have been added via dynamic update. [RT #23229]
     * If a slave initiates a TSIG signed AXFR from the master and the
       master fails to correctly TSIG sign the final message, the slave
       would be left with the zone in an unclean state. named detected
       this error too late and named would crash with an INSIST. The order
       dependancy has been fixed. [RT #23254]
     * If the server has an IPv6 address but does not have IPv6
       connectivity to the internet, dig +trace could fail attempting to
       use IPv6 addresses. [RT #23297]
     * Changing TTL did not cause dnssec-signzone to generate new
       signatures. [RT #23330]
     * Have the validating resolver use RRSIG original TTL to compute
       validated RRset and RRSIG TTL. [RT #23332]
     * In "make test" bin/tests/resolver, hold the socket manager lock
       while freeing the socket. [RT #23333]
     * If named encountered a CNAME instead of a DS record when walking
       the chain of trust down from the trust anchor, it incorrectly
       stopped validating. [RT #23338]
     * RRSIG records could have time stamps too far in the future. [RT
       #23356]
     * named stores cached data in an in-memory database and keeps track
       of how recently the data is used with a heap. The heap is stored
       within the cache's memory space. Under a sustained high query load
       and with a small cache size, this could lead to the heap exhausting
       the cache space. This would result in cache misses and SERVFAILs,
       with named never releasing the cache memory the heap used up and
       never recovering. This fix removes the heap into its own memory
       space, preventing the heap from exhausting the cache space and
       allowing named to recover gracefully when the high query load
       abates. [RT #23371]
     * If running on a powerpc CPU and with atomic operations enabled,
       named could lock up. Added sync instructions to the end of atomic
       operations. [RT #23469]
     * If OpenSSL was built without engine support, named would have
       compile errors and fail to build. [RT #23473]
     * Handle isc_event_allocate failures in t_tasks test. [RT #23572]
     * ixfr-from-differences {master|slave}; failed to select the
       master/slave zones, resulting in on diff/journal file being
       created. [RT #23580]
     * If a DNAME substitution failed, named returned NOERROR. The correct
       response should be YXDOMAIN. [RT #23591]
     * Remove bin/tests/system/logfileconfig/ns1/named.conf and add
       setup.sh in order to resolve changing named.conf issue. [RT #23687]
     * NOTIFY messages were not being sent when generating a NSEC3 chain
       incrementally. [RT #23702]
     * Signatures for records at the zone apex could go stale due to an
       incorrect timer setting. [RT #23769]
     * The autosign tests attempted to open ports within reserved ranges.
       Test now avoids those ports. [RT #23957]
     * named, acting as authoritative server for DLZ zones, was not
       correctly setting the authoritative (AA) bit. [RT #24146]
     * Clean up some cross-compiling issues and added two undocumented
       configure options, --with-gost and --with-rlimtype, to allow
       over-riding default settings (gost=no and rlimtype="long int") when
       cross-compiling. [RT #24367]
     * When trying sign with NSEC3, if dnssec-signzone couldn't find the
       KSK, it would give an incorrect error "NSEC3 iterations too big for
       weakest DNSKEY strength" rather than the correct "failed to find
       keys at the zone apex: not found" [RT #24369]
     * nsupdate could dump core on shutdown when using SIG(0) keys. [RT
       #24604]
     * Named could fail to validate zones list in a DLV that validated
       insecure without using DLV and had DS records in the parent zone.
       [RT #24631]
     * A bug in FreeBSD kernels causes IPv6 UDP responses greater than
       1280 bytes to not fragment as they should. Until there is a kernel
       fix, named will work around this by setting IPV6_USE_MIN_MTU on a
       per packet basis. [RT #24950]
     * To avoid excessive startup time for configurations with large
       numbers of zones, an environment variable, BIND9_ZONE_TASKS_HINTS,
       may now be set prior to starting named. Divide your number of zones
       by 200 to find the recommended setting for this environment
       variable (i.e., if you have 200000 zones, set
       BIND9_ZONE_TASKS_HINTS to 1000 before starting named). [RT #25084]

Known issues in this release

     * "make test" will fail on OSX and possibly other operating systems.
       The failure occurs in a new test to check for allow-query ACLs. The
       failure is caused because the source address is not specified on
       the dig commands issued in the test.
       If running "make test" is part of your usual acceptance process,
       please edit the file bin/tests/system/allow_query/test.sh and add
       -b 10.53.0.2
       to the DIGOPTS line.
