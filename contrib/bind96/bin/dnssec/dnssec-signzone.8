.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBdnssec\-signzone\fR signs a zone\&. It generates NSEC and RRSIG records and produces a signed version of the zone\&. The security status of delegations from the signed zone (that is, whether the child zones are secure or not) is determined by the presence or absence of a \fIkeyset\fR file for each child zone\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\-a
Verify all generated signatures\&.
.TP
\-c \fIclass\fR
Specifies the DNS class of the zone\&.
.TP
\-k \fIkey\fR
Treat specified key as a key signing key ignoring any key flags\&. This option may be specified multiple times\&.
.TP
\-l \fIdomain\fR
Generate a DLV set in addition to the key (DNSKEY) and DS sets\&. The domain is appended to the name of the records\&.
.TP
\-d \fIdirectory\fR
Look for \fIkeyset\fR files in \fBdirectory\fR as the directory
.TP
\-g
Generate DS records for child zones from keyset files\&. Existing DS records will be removed\&.
.TP
\-s \fIstart\-time\fR
Specify the date and time when the generated RRSIG records become valid\&. This can be either an absolute or relative time\&. An absolute start time is indicated by a number in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS notation; 20000530144500 denotes 14:45:00 UTC on May 30th, 2000\&. A relative start time is indicated by +N, which is N seconds from the current time\&. If no \fBstart\-time\fR is specified, the current time minus 1 hour (to allow for clock skew) is used\&.
.TP
\-e \fIend\-time\fR
Specify the date and time when the generated RRSIG records expire\&. As with \fBstart\-time\fR, an absolute time is indicated in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS notation\&. A time relative to the start time is indicated with +N, which is N seconds from the start time\&. A time relative to the current time is indicated with now+N\&. If no \fBend\-time\fR is specified, 30 days from the start time is used as a default\&.
.TP
\-f \fIoutput\-file\fR
The name of the output file containing the signed zone\&. The default is to append \fI\&.signed\fR to the input filename\&.
.TP
\-h
Prints a short summary of the options and arguments to \fBdnssec\-signzone\fR\&.
.TP
\-i \fIinterval\fR
When a previously\-signed zone is passed as input, records may be resigned\&. The \fBinterval\fR option specifies the cycle interval as an offset from the current time (in seconds)\&. If a RRSIG record expires after the cycle interval, it is retained\&. Otherwise, it is considered to be expiring soon, and it will be replaced\&.
The default cycle interval is one quarter of the difference between the signature end and start times\&. So if neither \fBend\-time\fR or \fBstart\-time\fR are specified, \fBdnssec\-signzone\fR generates signatures that are valid for 30 days, with a cycle interval of 7\&.5 days\&. Therefore, if any existing RRSIG records are due to expire in less than 7\&.5 days, they would be replaced\&.
.TP
\-I \fIinput\-format\fR
The format of the input zone file\&. Possible formats are \fB"text"\fR (default) and \fB"raw"\fR\&. This option is primarily intended to be used for dynamic signed zones so that the dumped zone file in a non\-text format containing updates can be signed directly\&. The use of this option does not make much sense for non\-dynamic zones\&.
.TP
\-j \fIjitter\fR
When signing a zone with a fixed signature lifetime, all RRSIG records issued at the time of signing expires simultaneously\&. If the zone is incrementally signed, i\&.e\&. a previously\-signed zone is passed as input to the signer, all expired signatures have to be regenerated at about the same time\&. The \fBjitter\fR option specifies a jitter window that will be used to randomize the signature expire time, thus spreading incremental signature regeneration over time\&.
Signature lifetime jitter also to some extent benefits validators and servers by spreading out cache expiration, i\&.e\&. if large numbers of RRSIGs don't expire at the same time from all caches there will be less congestion than if all validators need to refetch at mostly the same time\&.
.TP
\-n \fIncpus\fR
Specifies the number of threads to use\&. By default, one thread is started for each detected CPU\&.
.TP
\-N \fIsoa\-serial\-format\fR
The SOA serial number format of the signed zone\&. Possible formats are \fB"keep"\fR (default), \fB"increment"\fR and \fB"unixtime"\fR\&.
.RS
.TP
\fB"keep"\fR
Do not modify the SOA serial number\&.
.TP
\fB"increment"\fR
Increment the SOA serial number using RFC 1982 arithmetics\&.
.TP
\fB"unixtime"\fR
Set the SOA serial number to the number of seconds since epoch\&.
.RE
.IP
.TP
\-o \fIorigin\fR
The zone origin\&. If not specified, the name of the zone file is assumed to be the origin\&.
.TP
\-O \fIoutput\-format\fR
The format of the output file containing the signed zone\&. Possible formats are \fB"text"\fR (default) and \fB"raw"\fR\&.
.TP
\-p
Use pseudo\-random data when signing the zone\&. This is faster, but less secure, than using real random data\&. This option may be useful when signing large zones or when the entropy source is limited\&.
.TP
\-r \fIrandomdev\fR
Specifies the source of randomness\&. If the operating system does not provide a \fI/dev/random\fR or equivalent device, the default source of randomness is keyboard input\&. \fIrandomdev\fR specifies the name of a character device or file containing random data to be used instead of the default\&. The special value \fIkeyboard\fR indicates that keyboard input should be used\&.
.TP
\-t
Print statistics at completion\&.
.TP
\-v \fIlevel\fR
Sets the debugging level\&.
.TP
\-z
Ignore KSK flag on key when determining what to sign\&.
.TP
\-3 \fIsalt\fR
Generate a NSEC3 chain with the given hex encoded salt\&. A dash (\fIsalt\fR) can be used to indicate that no salt is to be used when generating the NSEC3 chain\&.
.TP
\-H \fIiterations\fR
When generating a NSEC3 chain use this many interations\&. The default is 100\&.
.TP
\-A
When generating a NSEC3 chain set the OPTOUT flag on all NSEC3 records and do not generate NSEC3 records for insecure delegations\&.
.TP
zonefile
The file containing the zone to be signed\&.
.TP
key
Specify which keys should be used to sign the zone\&. If no keys are specified, then the zone will be examined for DNSKEY records at the zone apex\&. If these are found and there are matching private keys, in the current directory, then these will be used for signing\&.
.SH "EXAMPLE"
.PP
The following command signs the \fBexample\&.com\fR zone with the DSA key generated by \fBdnssec\-keygen\fR (Kexample\&.com\&.+003+17247)\&. The zone's keys must be in the master file (\fIdb\&.example\&.com\fR)\&. This invocation looks for \fIkeyset\fR files, in the current directory, so that DS records can be generated from them (\fB\-g\fR)\&.
.nf
% dnssec\-signzone \-g \-o example\&.com db\&.example\&.com \\
Kexample\&.com\&.+003+17247
db\&.example\&.com\&.signed
%
.fi
.PP
In the above example, \fBdnssec\-signzone\fR creates the file \fIdb\&.example\&.com\&.signed\fR\&. This file should be referenced in a zone statement in a \fInamed\&.conf\fR file\&.
.PP
This example re\-signs a previously signed zone with default parameters\&. The private keys are assumed to be in the current directory\&.
.nf
% cp db\&.example\&.com\&.signed db\&.example\&.com
% dnssec\-signzone \-o example\&.com db\&.example\&.com
db\&.example\&.com\&.signed
%
.fi
.SH "KNOWN BUGS"
.PP
 \fBdnssec\-signzone\fR was designed so that it could sign a zone partially, using only a subset of the DNSSEC keys needed to produce a fully\-signed zone\&. This permits a zone administrator, for example, to sign a zone with one key on one machine, move the resulting partially\-signed zone to a second machine, and sign it again with a second key\&.
.PP
An unfortunate side\-effect of this flexibility is that \fBdnssec\-signzone\fR does not check to make sure it's signing a zone with any valid keys at all\&. An attempt to sign a zone without any keys will appear to succeed, producing a "signed" zone with no signatures\&. There is no warning issued when a zone is not fully signed\&.
.PP
This will be corrected in a future release\&. In the meantime, ISC recommends examining the output of \fBdnssec\-signzone\fR to confirm that the zone is properly signed by all keys before using it\&.
