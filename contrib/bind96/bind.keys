# This file contains current trust anchors for the DNS root zone (".")
# and for the ISC DNSSEC Lookaside Validation zone ("dlv.isc.org").  It is
# provided within BIND 9 for convenience of configuration.  To use these
# keys, copy the trusted-keys statement below into named.conf, or else set
# named.conf to "include" this file.
#
# These keys are current as of January 2011.  If any key fails to
# work correctly, it may have expired.  In that event, you should
# replace this file with a current version.  The latest version of
# bind.keys can always be obtained from ISC at https://www.isc.org/bind-keys.
#
# (NOTE: If this file is used via the "include" directive in named.conf,
# then it is NOT advisable to modify it.  In BIND 9.7 and higher, this file
# is used directly by named.  Upgrades to BIND may overwrite the file and
# eliminate any user-configured keys.  Furthermore, in those versions of
# BIND, this file can only be used for a specific set of domain names, and
# any other trust anchors configured here would be ignored.  So, while it
# is possible to use this file for other trust anchors in BIND 9.6, doing
# so may lead to problems when you upgrade.)
