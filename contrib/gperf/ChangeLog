1998-05-20  Bruno Haible  <bruno@linuix.mathematik.uni-karlsruhe.de>

        * doc/Makefile.in (gperf.dvi, clean): Remove gperf.cps.
          (install, installdirs, uninstall): Don't install gperf.dvi. The
          info and HTML documentations are sufficient for on-line use, and
          users who wish to print the documentation (in PS or DVI format)
          can do this directly off the source distribution.
          (DVIPS): Use "-D600" instead of "-Pljfour", for portability.

1998-05-20  Akim Demaille  <demaille@inf.enst.fr>

        * doc/gperf.texi: Many modifications:
          (Output Format): Declare `hash' and `in_word_set' as functions.
          (Concept Index): New section.

          update works.
          (Motivation): Avoid spaces in @var.
          (Options): Use the standard name ``Invoking ...''.
          (Options): Declare also the long form of the options.

Sat May  2 13:20:54 1998  Bruno Haible  <bruno@linuix.mathematik.uni-karlsruhe.de>

        * gperf-2.7 released.

Sat May  2 12:31:51 1998  Bruno Haible  <bruno@linuix.mathematik.uni-karlsruhe.de>

        * src/version.cc (version_string): Remove the "(C++ version)" suffix.
          It's redundant: the early C versions of gperf are called cperf.
          Reported by Karl Berry.
        * src/option.cc (Options::operator()): Trim the output of "gperf -v".

Thu Apr 16 13:22:16 1998  Bruno Haible  <bruno@linuix.mathematik.uni-karlsruhe.de>

        * lib/Makefile.in, src/Makefile.in: Don't use $(TARGET_ARCH).
          Solaris "make" sets it to a value not understood by "cc".

Wed Apr 15 23:52:14 1998  Bruno Haible  <bruno@linuix.mathematik.uni-karlsruhe.de>

        * lib/Makefile.in, src/Makefile.in: Don't use implicit rules. Don't
          use $<. AIX "make" and OSF/1 "make" have problems with both.
        * src/gen-perf.cc, src/key-list.cc: Cast free() argument to char*,
          otherwise it doesn't compile on SunOS 4.
        * src/key-list.h: Declare structs outside of other declarations,
          needed for OSF/1 cxx 5.5.
        * lib/getopt.h: Use prototypes if __STDC__ || __cplusplus.
          Don't give a prototype for getopt(), to avoid error on SunOS 4.
        * lib/getopt.c: Declare strncmp, to avoid warnings.

Tue Apr 14 23:24:07 1998  Bruno Haible  <bruno@linuix.mathematik.uni-karlsruhe.de>

        * lib/GetOpt.{h,cc}: Remove files.
        * lib/getopt.{h,c}, lib/getopt1.c: New files, from GNU libc.
        * lib/configure.in (AC_INIT): Search for hash.cc, not GetOpt.cc.
        * lib/Makefile.in (OBJECTS): Remove GetOpt.o, add getopt.o, getopt1.o.
          (getopt.o, getopt1.o, hash.o): Use explicit building rules. Some
          "make"s don't support to have both implicit rules for "%.o : %.c"
          and "%.o : %.cc" in the same Makefile.
        * lib/hash.{h,cc}: Remove #pragma; there are no templates here.
        * src/option.h (Options::usage): Remove.
          (Options::short_usage, Options::long_usage): Declare.
        * src/option.cc (Options::usage): Remove.
          (Options::short_usage, Options::long_usage): New functions.
          (long_options): New array.
          (Options::operator()): Use getopt_long instead of GetOpt::operator(),
          change all references to GetOpt members.

        * src/std-err.{h,cc}: Remove files.
        * src/gen-perf.cc, src/key-list.cc, list-node.cc, new.cc, options.cc:
          Call fprintf(stderr) instead of Std_Err::report_error().
        * src/key-list.h, src/list-node.h, src/options.h: Don't use class
          Std_Err any more.
        * src/option.cc (program_name): New variable.
        * src/Makefile.in: Remove STD_ERR_H.
          (OBJECTS): Remove std-err.o.

Mon Mar 23 01:03:35 1998  Bruno Haible  <bruno@linuix.mathematik.uni-karlsruhe.de>

        * aclocal.m4, {lib,src,tests}/configure.in: Remove CL_CC_WORKS and
          CL_CXX_WORKS, already contained in autoconf 2.12.

        * src/gen-perf.cc, src/key-list.cc: Move some code from
          Gen_Perf::Gen_Perf() to Key_List::output().
        * src/Makefile.in: Update dependencies.

        * src/options.{h,cc}: Remove option "-p".
        * src/key-list.cc (Key_List::set_output_types): Rewrite.
          (default_array_type, default_return_type): Remove.
        * src/key-list.cc: Adjust "const" handling.
          + With option "-t" [TYPE], don't emit wrong code if there is no
            space before the struct's opening brace.

Sun Mar 22 16:59:15 1998  Bruno Haible  <bruno@linuix.mathematik.uni-karlsruhe.de>

        * src/key-list.{h,cc}: Completely reorganized the output routines.
          Rewrote from scratch the output_switch() function. Use classes
          (Output_Constants, Output_Expr, Output_Compare) for abstraction.
          In particular:
          + Don't emit trailing whitespace and spurious blank lines.
          + Adjust indentation of the arrays.
          + Don't emit commas at the end of array initializers and
            struct initializers.
          + With option "-l" [LENTABLE], compare the length before
            fetching the word from memory.
          + With option "-S" [SWITCH], emit the comparison code just once,
            not once in every switch statement.
          + With option "-S" [SWITCH], choose the right switch statement
            through a binary search, not a linear search.
          + With option "-S" [SWITCH], emit straightforward comparisons
            instead of switch statements with just one "case" label.
          + With options "-S -p -t" [SWITCH, POINTER, TYPE], don't emit
            spurious empty elements at the beginning of the wordlist array.
          + With option "-D" [DUP] and not option "-S" [SWITCH], if there
            is no more room for duplicate entries in the lookup array,
            don't call `assert (i != 0)'. Instead, make the array larger :-)
          + With option "-D" [DUP], if there are no duplicates, don't
            automatically fall back to the non-"-D" algorithm. If the user
            wants the non-"-D" algorithm, he can just not specify "-D".
          + With option "-D" [DUP] and either options "-p -t" [POINTER, TYPE]
            or not option "-S" [SWITCH], don't emit spurious empty elements
            at the beginning of the wordlist array.
          + With option "-D" [DUP], simplify the detection and processing
            of duplicate entries in the lookup array.
          + With options "-D -l" [DUP, LENTABLE] and not option "-S" [SWITCH],
            don't forget to emit the lengthtable array.
          + With options "-D -l -S" [DUP, LENTABLE, SWITCH], don't forget to
            compare the lengths before comparing the strings.

        * src/gen-perf.cc: No need to include <assert.h>.
        * src/options.cc: Likewise.

        * src/options.cc: Don't use `errno' after freopen failed.
        * src/std-err.cc: `report_error' doesn't call strerror(errno) any
          more. No need to include <string.h> and <errno.h>.

        * tests/Makefile.in (check-*): Any difference between .exp and .out
          is a failure. Don't ignore whitespace differences.

        * tests/Makefile.in (check-lang-syntax): Add some more checks.

Fri Mar 20 00:54:54 1998  Bruno Haible  <bruno@linuix.mathematik.uni-karlsruhe.de>

        * tests/jscript.gperf: Renamed from tests/javascript.gperf, because
          of Minix and SVR2 14-character filename limit.
        * src/key-list.cc (output_string): New function.
          (Key_List::output_switch, Key_List::output_keyword_table): Call it.

        * src/options.{h,icc,cc} (get_wordlist_name): New function. Add
          option -W.
        * src/key-list.cc (Key_List::output_switch,
          Key_List::output_keyword_table, Key_List::output_lookup_function):
          Use it.
        Patch from William Bader <wbader@CSEE.Lehigh.Edu>.

        * src/version.cc: Bump version number directly from 2.5 to 2.7,
          because Schmidt's last release from 1991 carries version number 2.6.

Tue Jul 30 00:02:39 1991  Douglas C. Schmidt  (schmidt at net4.ics.uci.edu)

        * Fixed a small bug in the Key_List::output_keyword_table routine
          that caused an extra newline to be printed if there where no
          leading blank entries... (who cares, right?!)

Mon Jul 29 22:05:40 1991  Douglas C. Schmidt  (schmidt at net4.ics.uci.edu)

        * Modified the handling of the -E (emit enums rather than
          #defines) option in conjunction with the -G option.  Now, if -G
          and -E are given the enums are generated outside the lookup
          function, rather than within it!

Mon Apr  8 18:17:04 1991  Doug Schmidt  (schmidt at net4.ics.uci.edu)

        * Yucko, there was a bug in the handling of -c (and of course the
          new -I command in key-list.cc).  Apparently when I added the
          super-duper hack that provided support for duplicate keys I
          forgot to update the strcmp output...

Mon Mar  9 02:19:04 1998  Bruno Haible  <bruno@linuix.mathematik.uni-karlsruhe.de>

        * Moved the documentation to doc/, put the stuff borrowed from
          libg++ into lib/.
        * Rewrote all Makefile.in's for better compliance with GNU standards.
        * Autoconf based configuration. Rewrote all configure.in's. Added
          aclocal.m4, with macros from CLISP and CLN. Added Makefile.devel.
        * src/depend: Removed. Dependencies are now in src/Makefile.in.

        * src/bool-array.icc: New file, contains inline functions, from both
          src/bool-array.h and src/bool-array.cc.

	* Makefile.in (src_all):  Make less verbose output.

Fri May 28 14:01:18 1993  Per Bothner  (bothner@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* src/gen-perf.cc (Gen_Perf::change):  Don't use gcc-specific
	2-operand conditional expression.
	* src/key-list.cc (Key_List::output_lookup_array):
	Don't use variable-size stack arrays, unless compiled by g++.

Tue May  4 14:08:44 1993  Per Bothner  (bothner@cygnus.com)

	Changes (mostly from Peter Schauer) to permit compilation
	using cfront 3.0 and otherwise be ARM-conforming.
	* src/key-list.h:  class Key_List must use public derivation
	of base class Std_Err (because Gen_Perf::operator() in gen-perf.cc
	calls Std_Err::report_error).
	* src/gen-perf.cc (Gen_Perf::affects_prev), src/hash-table.cc
	(Hash_Table::operator()):  Don't use gcc-specific 2-operand

Tue Apr 27 20:11:30 1993  Per Bothner  (bothner@cygnus.com)

	* src/Makefile.in:  Define TARGETPROG, and use it.

Mon Apr 19 00:29:18 1993  Per Bothner  (bothner@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in, configure.in:  Re-vamped configure scheme.

Sat Jan 30 20:21:28 1993  Brendan Kehoe  (brendan@lisa.cygnus.com)

	* tests/Makefile.in (mostlyclean): Also delete aout, cout, m3out,
	pout, and preout.

Tue Dec 29 08:58:17 1992  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: pass $(FLAGS_TO_PASS) to all calls to make.
	(FLAGS_TO_PASS): added INSTALL, INSTALL_DATA, INSTALL_PROGRAM.

Mon Dec 21 18:46:46 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* tests/expected.* renamed to *.exp to fit in 14 chars.

	Also rename output.* to *.out.
	* src/Makefile.in (clean):  Remove gperf program.

	Makefile before recursing.

Fri Nov  6 13:41:49 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* key-list.{h,cc}:  Remove MAX_INT (and similar) constant
	fields from Key_List class, and use INT_MAX (etc) from limits.h.
	* key-list.{h,cc}, options.{h,cc}, vectors.h:  Removed all
	uses of initialized const fields, as they are non-standard
	- and their use was easy to do away with.  Mostly, just
	made the constants static non-fields in the .cc file.

Mon Nov  2 13:10:11 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@cygnus.com)

	* tests/Makefile.in:  When generating cinset.c, don't pass -C,
	since -C assumes an ANSI compiler.  Add the -C flag (with -a)
	when generating test.out.3 instead.
	* tests/expected.out.3:  Update accordingly.

Wed Aug 12 11:47:54 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in:  Factor out common flags into $(FLAGS_TO_PASS).
	* Makefile.in:  'install-info' depends on gperf.info.

Mon Aug 10 11:39:52 1992  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@dumbest.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in, src/Makefile.in: always create installation
	directories.

Mon Jul 20 15:33:21 1992  Mike Stump  (mrs@cygnus.com)

	* src/new.cc (operator new):  Add cast from void * to char *,
	since it is not a standard conversion.

Wed Jun 17 16:25:30 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* src/gen-perf.cc:  #include <_G_config.h> for _G_SYSV.
	* src/key-list.cc:  alloca() hair.
	* src/main.cc (main):  Only call getrlimit if _G_HAVE_SYS_RESOURCE.

	* tests/Makefile.in (clean): Fix.

Sat Mar  7 00:03:56 1992  K. Richard Pixley  (rich@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* gperf.texinfo: added menu item hook.

Wed Feb 26 18:04:40 1992  K. Richard Pixley  (rich@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in, configure.in: removed traces of namesubdir,
	  -subdirs, $(subdir), $(unsubdir), some rcs triggers.  Forced
	  copyrights to '92, changed some from Cygnus to FSF.

Sun Jan 26 19:21:58 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner at cygnus.com)

	* tests/Makefile.in:  Use re-directed stdin instead of file
	name in argv.  This allows us to remove the filename
	from the output, the expected output, and hence the diffs.
	(Note that the input file is in $(srcdir), which we cannot
	place in the expected out files.)
	* tests/expected.out.[1235]:  Edit out input filename,
	to match new output.

Thu Jun 28 16:17:27 1990  Doug Schmidt  (schmidt at brilliant)

	* Wow, first fix on the new job!  There was a dumb error
	  in Key_List::output_lookup_function, where I printed the
	  string "&wordlist[key]" instead of the correct "&wordlist[index]".
	  
	* Added a couple of #ifdefs for USG support.
	  	
Sun Jun  3 17:16:36 1990  Doug Schmidt  (schmidt at crimee.ics.uci.edu)

        * Updated the version number to 2.5 and sent to Doug Lea for release
          with the latest GNU libg++.

        * Changed the error handling when a keyword file cannot be opened
          (now calls perror).

Wed May 30 14:49:40 1990  Doug Schmidt  (schmidt at crimee.ics.uci.edu)

        * Instrumented the source code with trace statements automagically
          inserted using my new automated trace instrumentation tool!

Wed May  9 11:47:41 1990  Doug Schmidt  (schmidt at siam.ics.uci.edu)

        * Really fixed the previous bug.  Turns out that a small amount
          of logic had to be duplicated to handle static links that occur
          as part of dynamic link chains.  What a pain!!!

Tue May  8 23:11:44 1990  Doug Schmidt  (schmidt at siam.ics.uci.edu)

        * Fixed a stupid bug in Key_List::output_lookup_array that was
          causing incorrect counts to be generated when there were both
          static and dynamic links occurring for the same hash value.
          Also simplified the code that performs the logic in this routine.

Mon Apr 30 17:37:24 1990  Doug Schmidt  (schmidt at crimee.ics.uci.edu)

        * Fixed stupid bug in Key_List::output_lookup_array that was
          making the generated lookup[] array contain `chars' even
          when the values stored in the chars are greater than 127!

        * Changed the behavior of the -G (global table) option so that it
          will output the `length[]' array in the global scope along with
          the `word_list[]' array.

        * Fixed a stupid bug in Key_List::output_lookup_function that
          would always output the complicated `duplicate-handling' lookup
          logic, even when there were no duplicates in the input!

        * Yikes, had to modify a bunch of stuff in key-list.cc to correctly
          handle duplicate entries.  Changed the generated code so that
          the MIN_HASH_VALUE is no longer subtracted off when calculating
          the hash value for a keyword.  This required changing some other
          code by substituting MAX_HASH_VALUE for TOTAL_KEYS in several places.
          Finally, this means that the generated tables may contain leading 
          null entries, but I suppose it is better to trade-off space to get 
          faster performance...

Mon Mar 26 13:08:43 1990  Doug Schmidt  (schmidt at crimee.ics.uci.edu)

        * Updated version number to 2.4 to reflect the latest changes.

        * Changed the main program so that it always prints out gperf's
          execution timings to the generated output file.
          
Sun Mar 25 12:39:30 1990  Doug Schmidt  (schmidt at crimee.ics.uci.edu)

        * Added the -Z option so that users can specify the name of the
          generated class explicitly.  Updated documentation to reflect
          this change.
          
        * Modified the generated C++ class interface so that the functions
          are declared static (to remove the overhead of passing the `this'
          pointer).  This means that operator()() can no longer be used,
          since it only works on non-static member functions.
          Also changed things so that there is no constructor (why waste
          the extra call, when it doesn't do anything, eh?)

        * Modified the behavior of Key_List::output when the -L C++ option
          is enabled.  Previously the code generated use const data members
          to record MIN_WORD_LENGTH, MIN_HASH_VALUE, etc.  However, as
          pointed out by James Clark this may result in suboptimal behavior
          on the part of C++ compilers that can't inline these values.
          Therefore, the new behavior is identical to what happens with
          -L C, i.e., either #defines or function-specific enums are used.
          Why sacrifice speed for some abstract notion of `code purity?' ;-)

Tue Mar  6 18:17:42 1990  Doug Schmidt  (schmidt at crimee.ics.uci.edu)

        * Added the -E option that defines constant values using an enum
          local to the lookup function rather than with #defines.  This
          also means that different lookup functions can reside in the
          same file.  Thanks to James Clark (jjc@ai.mit.edu). 

Sat Mar  3 20:19:00 1990  Doug Schmidt  (schmidt at zola.ics.uci.edu)

        * Added a special case to key_list::output_switch that doesn't
          generate extra comparisons when the `-S' is given an argument
          of 1 (the normal case).  This should speed up the generated
          code output a tad...

Fri Feb 23 14:21:28 1990  Doug Schmidt  (schmidt at zola.ics.uci.edu)

        * Renamed all instances of member function get_keysig_size
          to get_max_keysig_size, since this is more precise...

        * Changed all occurrences of charset to keysig (stands for ``key
          signature'') to reflect the new naming convention used in the 
          USENIX paper.

Thu Feb 22 11:28:36 1990  Doug Schmidt  (schmidt at crimee.ics.uci.edu)

        * Changed the name of the generated associated values table from
          asso_value to asso_values to reflect conventions in the USENIX
          C++ paper.

Thu Feb 15 23:29:03 1990  Doug Schmidt  (schmidt at zola.ics.uci.edu)

        * Updated the gperf.texinfo file to fix some formatting problems
          that had crept in since last time.

Wed Feb 14 23:27:24 1990  Doug Schmidt  (schmidt at zola.ics.uci.edu)

        * Fixed stupid bug in key-list.cc (get_special_input), wher
          gperf replaced each '%' with the succeeding character.

        * Added support for multiple target language generation.  Currently
          handled languages are C and C++, with C as the default.  Updated
          documentation and option handler to reflect the changes.

        * Added a global destructor to new.cc and removed the #ifdef, since
          the bloody thing now works with libg++.

Mon Feb 14 13:00:00 1990  Doug Schmidt  (schmidt at zola.ics.uci.edu)

        * Found out that my gperf paper was accepted at the upcoming
          USENIX C++ Conference in San Francisco.  Yow!

Tue Jan 30 09:00:29 1990  Doug Schmidt  (schmidt at zola.ics.uci.edu)

        * #ifdef'd out the new.cc memory allocator, since there are
          problems with this and the libg++ stuff.

        * Changed key-list.h so that class Vectors is a public (rather
          than private) base class for class Key_List.  The previous
          form was illegal C++, but wasn't being caught by the old
          g++ compiler.  Should work now... ;-)

Sun Dec 10 14:08:23 1989  Doug Schmidt  (schmidt at glacier.ics.uci.edu)

        * Added several changes from rfg@ics.uci.edu.  These changes
          help to automate the build process.

Wed Nov 15 15:49:33 1989  Doug Schmidt  (schmidt at zola.ics.uci.edu)

        * Removed conditional compilation for GATHER_STATISTICS.  There's
          really no good reason to avoid collecting this info at run-time,
          since that section of code is *hardly* the bottleneck... ;-)

        * Simplified the C output routines in Key_List::set_output_types
          and Key_List::output_keyword_table a bit in order to
          speed-up and clean up the code generation.

        * Modified function Key_List::get_special_input so that it does
          not try to `delete' a buffer that turned out to be too short.
          This is important since the new memory management scheme
          does not handle deletions.  However, adding a small amount of
          garbage won't hurt anything, since we generally don't do this
          operation more than a couple times *at most*!

        * Created a new file (new.cc) which includes my own overloaded
          operator new.  This function should dramatically reduce the
          number of calls to malloc since it grabs large chunks and
          doles them out in small pieces.  As a result of this change
          the class-specific `operator new' was removed from class List_Node.

Tue Nov 14 21:45:30 1989  Doug Schmidt  (schmidt at glacier.ics.uci.edu)

        * Continued to refine the great hack.  The latest trick is to
          try and replace most uses of dynamic memory (i.e., calls to
          new) with uses of gcc dynamic arrays (i.e., an alloca solution).
          This makes life much easier for the overall process-size, since 
          it reduces the amount of overhead for memory management.  As a
          side-effect from this change there is no reason to have the
          Bool_Array::dispose member function, so it's outta here!

        * Fixed a stupid bug that was an disaster waiting to happen...
          Instead of making the boolean array large enough to index
          max_hash_value it was only large enough to index max_hash_value
          - 1.  Once again, an off-by-one mistake in C/C++!!!!

Mon Nov 13 19:38:27 1989  Doug Schmidt  (schmidt at glacier.ics.uci.edu)

        * Added the final great hack!  This allows us to generate hash tables
          for near-perfect hash functions that contain duplicates, *without*
          having to use switch statements!  Since many compilers die on large
          switch statements this feature is essential.  Furthermore, it appears
          that the generated code is often *smaller* than that put out by
          compilers, even though a large, sparse array must be created.
          Here's the general idea:

             a. Generate the wordlist as a contiguous block of keywords, 
                just as before when using a switch statement.  This
                wordlist *must* be sorted by hash value. 

             b. Generate the lookup array, which is an array of signed
                {chars,shorts,ints}, (which ever allows full coverage of
                the wordlist dimensions).  If the value v, where v =
                lookup[hash(str,len)], is >= 0 and < TOTAL_KEYWORDS, then we
                simply use this result as a direct access into the wordlist 
                array to snag the keyword for comparison.  

             c. Otherwise, if v is < -TOTAL_KEYWORDS or > TOTAL_KEYWORDS
                this is an indication that we'll need to search through
                some number of duplicates hash values.  Using a hash
                linking scheme we'd then index into a different part of
                the hash table that provides the starting index and total
                length of the duplicate entries to find via linear search!

Sun Nov 12 13:48:10 1989  Doug Schmidt  (schmidt at zola.ics.uci.edu)

        * Simplified Key_List::output_min_max considerably by recognizing
          that since the keyword list was already sorted by hash value finding 
          the min and max values is trivial!

        * Improved the debugging diagnostics considerably in classes Key_List,
          Hash_Table, and Gen_Perf.

        * Modified the `-s' option so that a negative argument is now 
          interpreted to mean `allow the maximum associated value to be
          about x times *smaller* than the number of input keys.'  This
          should help prevent massive explosion of generated hash table
          size for large keysets.

Sat Nov 11 11:31:13 1989  Doug Schmidt  (schmidt at glacier.ics.uci.edu)

        * Added a field in class Key_List that counts the total number
          of duplicate keywords, both static and dynamic.

        * Added a new member function Bool_Array that deletes the dynamic
          memory allocated to Bool_Array::storage_array.  This space may
          be needed for subsequent options, so it made sense to free it as
          soon as possible...
          
        * Renamed file/class Alpha_Vectors to Vectors, to avoid problems
          with 14 character length filenames on SYSV.  Also changed file
          adapredefined.gperf to adadefs.gperf in the ./tests directory.

        * Modified class Options by changing the member function
          Options::total_positions to Options::get_charset_size and
          Options::set_charset_size.  These two routines now either return
          the total charset size *or* the length of the largest keyword
          if the user specifies the -k'*' (ALLCHARS) option.  This change
          cleans up client code.

        * Merged all the cperf changes into gperf.
        
        * Made sure to explicitly initialize perfect.fewest_collisions to
          0.

        * Cleaned up some loose ends noticed by Nels Olson.
          1.  Removed `if (collisions <= perfect.fewest_collisions)'
              from Gen_Perf::affects_prev since it was superfluous.
          2.  Removed the fields best_char_value and best_asso_value
              from Gen_Perf.  There were also unnecessary.
          3.  Fixed a braino in the Bool_Array::bool_array_reset
              function.  Since iteration numbers can never be zero
              the `if (bool_array.iteration_number++ == 0)' must be
              `if (++bool_array.iteration_number == 0).'
          4.  Modified Std_Err::report_error so that it correctly handles
              "%%".

        * It is important to note that -D no longer enables -S.
          There is a good reason for this change, which will become
          manifested in the next release... (suspense!).

        * Made some subtle changes to Key_List::print_switch so that if finally
          seems to work correctly.  Needs more stress testing, however...

        * Made a major change to the Key_List::print_switch function.
          The user can now specify the number of switch statements to generate
          via an argument to the -S option, i.e., -S1 means `generate 1
          switch statement with all keywords in it,' -S2 means generate
          2 switch statements with 1/2 the elements in each one, etc.
          Hopefully this will fix the problem with C compilers not being
          able to generate code for giant switch statements (but don't
          hold your breath!)

        * Changed Key_List::length function to Key_List::keyword_list_length.

        * Added a feature to main.c that prints out the starting wall-clock
          time before the program begins and prints out the ending wall-clock
          time when the program is finished.

        * Added the GATHER_STATISTICS code in hash-table.c so we can
          keep track of how well double hashing is doing.  Eventually,
          GATHER_STATISTICS will be added so that all instrumentation
          code can be conditionally compiled in.

        * Fixed a stupid bug in Key_List::print_switch routine.  This
          was necessary to make sure the generated switch statement worked
          correctly when *both* `natural,' i.e., static links and dynamic
          links, i.e., unresolved duplicates, hash to the same value.

        * Modified Bool_Array::~Bool_Array destructor so that
          it now frees the bool_array.storage_array when it is no longer
          needed.  Since this array is generally very large it makes sense
          to return the memory to the freelist when it is no longer in use.

        * Changed the interface to constructor Hash_Table::Hash_Table.  This 
          constructor now passed a pointer to a power-of-two sized buffer that 
          serve as storage for the hash table.  Although this weakens information
          hiding a little bit it greatly reduces dynamic memory fragmentation,
          since we can now obtain the memory via a call to alloca, rather
          than malloc.  This change modified Key_List::read_keys calling
          interface.

        * Since alloca is now being used more aggressively a conditional
          compilation section was added in main.c. Taken from GNU GCC,
          this code gets rid of any avoidable limit on stack size so that
          alloca does not fail.  It is only used if the -DRLIMIT_STACK
          symbol is defined when gperf is compiled. 

        * Added warnings in option.c so that user's would be informed
          that -r superceeds -i on the command-line.
          
        * Rewrote Gen_Perf::affects_prev.  First, the code structure
          was cleaned up considerably (removing the need for a dreaded
          goto!).  Secondly, a major change occurred so that Gen_Perf::affects_prev
          returns FALSE (success) when fewest_hits gets down to whatever
          it was after inserting the previous key (instead of waiting for
          it to reach 0).  In other words, it stops trying if it can
          resolve the new collisions added by a key, even if there are
          still other old, unresolved collisions.  This modification was
          suggested by Nels Olson and seems to *greatly* increase the
          speed of gperf for large keyfiles.  Thanks Nels!

        * In a similar vein, inside the Gen_Perf::change routine 
          the variable `perfect.fewest_collisions is no longer initialized
          with the length of the keyword list.  Instead it starts out at
          0 and is incremented by 1 every time change () is called.
          The rationale for this behavior is that there are times when a
          collision causes the number of duplicates (collisions) to
          increase by a large amount when it would presumably just have
          gone up by 1 if none of the asso_values were changed.  That is,
          at the beginning of change(), you could initialize fewest_hits
          to 1+(previous value of fewest_hits) instead of to the number of
          keys.  Thanks again, Nels.

        * Replaced alloca with new in the Gen_Perf::change function.
          This should eliminate some overhead at the expense of a little
          extra memory that is never reclaimed.

        * Renamed Gen_Perf::merge_sets to Gen_Perf::compute_disjoint_union
          to reflect the change in behavior.

        * Added the -e option so users can supply a string containing
          the characters used to separate keywords from their attributes.
          The default behavior is ",\n".

        * Removed the char *uniq_set field from LIST_NODE and modified
          uses of uniq_set in perfect.c and keylist.c.  Due to changes
          to Gen_Perf::compute_disjoint_sets this field was no longer
          necessary, and its removal makes the program smaller and
          potentially faster. 
          
        * Added lots of changes/fixes suggested by Nels Olson
          (umls.UUCP!olson@mis.ucsf.edu).  In particular:
          1.  Changed Bool_Array so that it would dynamically create
              an array of unsigned shorts rather than ints if the 
              LO_CAL symbol was defined during program compilation.
              This cuts the amount of dynamic memory usage in half,
              which is important for large keyfile input.
          2.  Added some additional debugging statements that print extra
              info to stderr when the -d option is enabled.
          3.  Fixed a really stupid bug in Key_List::print_switch
              A right paren was placed at the wrong location, which broke
              strlen ().
          4.  Fixed a subtle problem with printing case values when keylinks
              appear.  The logic failed to account for the fact that there
              can be keylinks *and* regular node info also!
          5.  Changed the behavior of Key_List::read_keys so that it would
              honor -D unequivocally, i.e., it doesn't try to turn off dup
              handling if the user requests it, even if there are no
              immediate links in the keyfile input. 
          6.  Modified the -j option so that -j 0 means `try random values
              when searching for a way to resolve collisions.'
          7.  Added a field `num_done' to the Gen_Perf struct.  This is used
              to report information collected when trying to resolve
              hash collisions.
          8.  Modified the merge_sets algorithm to perform a disjoint
              union of two multisets.  This ensures that subsequent
              processing in Gen_Perf::affect_prev doesn't
              waste time trying to change an associated value that is
              shared between two conflicting keywords.
          9.  Modified Gen_Perf::affects_prev so that it doesn't try
              random jump values unless the -j 0 option is enabled.
          10. Fixed a silly bug in Gen_Perf::change.  This problem caused
              gperf to seg fault when the -k* option was given and the
              keyfile file had long keywords.
        
Sun Oct 29 00:18:55 1989  Doug Schmidt  (schmidt at siam.ics.uci.edu)

        * Modified class-specific new operations for Read_Line and
          List_Node so they don't fail if SIZE is larger than twice
          the previous buffer size.  Note we double buffer size
          everytime the previous buffer runs out, as a heuristic
          to reduce future calls to malloc.

Sun Oct 22 13:49:43 1989  Doug Schmidt  (schmidt at glacier.ics.uci.edu)

        * Updated gperf version number to 2.0.  Send to Doug Lea for
          incorporation into the long-awaited `official' libg++ 1.36
          release! 

        * Thanks to Nels Olson a silly bug in Gen_Perf::change ()
          was fixed.  This problem caused gperf to seg fault when
          the -k* option was given and the keyfile file had long
          keywords.
          
        * Modified Key_List::print_hash_function so that it output
          max_hash_value + 1 (rather than just max_hash_value) for
          any associated value entries that don't correspond to
          keyword charset characters.  This should speed up rejection
          of non-keyword strings a little in some cases.

Sat Oct 21 19:28:36 1989  Doug Schmidt  (schmidt at crimee.ics.uci.edu)

        * Fixed Key_List::print_hash_function so that it no longer output
          things like `return 0 + ...'  Although this probably gets
          optimized away by even the worst C compilers there isn't any
          point tempting fate... ;-)

        * Fixed class List_Node's constructor so that it wouldn't a priori
          refuse to consider trying to hash keys whose length is less
          than the smallest user-specified key position.  It turns out
          this is not a problem unless the user also specifies the -n
          (NOLENGTH) option, in which case such keys most likely
          don't have a prayer of being hashed correctly!

        * Changed the name of the generated lookup table from `Hash_Table'
          to `asso_value' to be consistent with the gperf paper.

Tue Oct 17 14:19:48 1989  Doug Schmidt  (schmidt at glacier.ics.uci.edu)

        * Added a flag GATHER_STATISTICS in the Makefile.  If defined
          during compilation this turns on certain collection facilities
          that track the performance of gperf during its execution.  In
          particular, I want to see how many collisions occur for the
          double hashing Hash_Table.

        * Added a safety check so that we don't screw up if the total
          number of `resets' of the Bool_Array exceeds MAX_INT.  Since
          this number is around 2^31 it is unlikely that this would ever
          occur for most input, but why take the risk?

        * Changed the behavior for the -a (ANSI) option so that the
          generated prototypes use int rather than size_t for the LEN 
          parameter.  It was too ugly having to #include <stddef.h> all
          over the place...

Mon Oct 16 11:00:35 1989  Doug Schmidt  (schmidt at crimee.ics.uci.edu)

        * Continued to work on the gperf paper for the USENIX C++
          conference.  At some point this will be merged back into
          the gperf documentation...

Sat Oct 14 20:29:43 1989  Doug Schmidt  (schmidt at siam.ics.uci.edu)

        * Added a majorly neat hack to Bool_Array, suggested by rfg.
          The basic idea was to throw away the Ullman array technique.
          The Ullman array was used to remove the need to reinitialize all 
          the Bool_Array elements to zero everytime we needed to determine
          whether there were duplicate hash values in the keyword list.  
          The current trick uses an `iteration number' scheme, which takes
          about 1/3 the space and reduces the overall program running a 
          time by about 20 percent for large input!  The hack works as 
          follows:
          
          1. Dynamically allocation 1 boolean array of size k.
          2. Initialize the boolean array to zeros, and consider the first
             iteration to be iteration 1.
          2. Then on all subsequent iterations we `reset' the bool array by
             kicking the iteration count by 1. 
          3. When it comes time to check whether a hash value is currently
             in the boolean array we simply check its index location.  If
             the value stored there is *not* equal to the current iteration
             number then the item is clearly *not* in the set.  In that
             case we assign the iteration number to that array's index
             location for future reference.  Otherwise, if the item at
             the index location *is* equal to the iteration number we've
             found a duplicate.  No muss, no fuss!
             
Mon Oct  2 12:30:54 1989  Doug Schmidt  (schmidt at glacier.ics.uci.edu)

        * Changed some consts in options.h to enumerals, since g++
          doesn't seem to like them at the moment!

Sat Sep 30 12:55:24 1989  Doug Schmidt  (schmidt at glacier.ics.uci.edu)

        * Fixed a stupid bug in Key_List::print_hash_function that manifested
          itself if the `-k$' option was given (i.e., only use the key[length]
          character in the hash function).

        * Added support for the -C option.  This makes the contents of
          all generated tables `readonly'.

        * Changed the handling of generated switches so that there is
          only one call to str[n]?cmp.  This *greatly* reduces the size of
          the generated assembly code on all compilers I've seen.

        * Fixed a subtle bug that occurred when the -l and -S option
          was given.  Code produced looked something like:

          if (len != key_len || !strcmp (s1, resword->name)) return resword;

          which doesn't make any sense.  Clearly, this should be:

          if (len == key_len && !strcmp (s1, resword->name)) return resword;

Tue Sep 26 10:36:50 1989  Doug Schmidt  (schmidt at glacier.ics.uci.edu)

        * Changed class Read_Line's definition so that it no longer
          needs to know about the buffering scheme used to speed up 
          dynamic memory allocation of input keywords and their
          associated attributes.  This means that operator new is no longer
          a friend of Read_Line.

Mon Sep 25 23:17:10 1989  Doug Schmidt  (schmidt at crimee.ics.uci.edu)

        * Decided that Obstacks had too much overhead, so they were
          removed in favor of super-efficient, low-overhead buffered
          storage allocation hacks in Read_Line and List_Node.

        * No longer try to inline functions that g++ complains about
          (Key_List::Merge and Key_List::Merge_Sort).

Sun Sep 24 13:11:24 1989  Doug Schmidt  (schmidt at glacier.ics.uci.edu)

        * Changed classes Read_Line and List_Node to use Obstacks in order
          to cache memory allocation for keyword strings and List_Nodes.
          
        * Continued to experiment with inheritance schemes.
        
        * Added a new file `alpha.h', that declares static data shared
          (i.e., inherited) between classes List_Node and Key_List.

Tue Sep 12 16:14:41 1989  Doug Schmidt  (schmidt at glacier.ics.uci.edu)

        * Made numerous changes to incorporate multiple inheritance in 
          gperf.

Wed Aug 16 23:04:08 1989  Doug Schmidt  (schmidt at glacier.ics.uci.edu)

        * Added the -DCOMPILER_FIXED flag to the ./src/Makefile.  This
          implies that people trying to compile gperf need to have a
          working version of the new g++ compiler (1.36.0).

        * Removed some extra spaces that were being added in the generated
          C code.

Mon Jul 24 17:09:46 1989  Doug Schmidt  (schmidt at glacier.ics.uci.edu)

        * Fixed PRINT_HASH_FUNCTION and PRINT_LOOKUP_FUNCTION in keylist.c
          so that the generated functions take an unsigned int length argument.
          If -a is enabled the prototype is (const char *str, size_t len).

Fri Jul 21 13:06:15 1989  Doug Schmidt  (schmidt at zola.ics.uci.edu)

        * Fixed a typo in PRINT_KEYWORD_TABLE in keylist.cc that prevented
          the indentation from working correctly.

        * Fixed a horrible typo in PRINT_KEYWORD_TABLE in keylist.cc
          that prevented links from being printed correctly.

Tue Jul 18 16:04:31 1989  Doug Schmidt  (schmidt at zola.ics.uci.edu)

        * Fixed up readline.cc and readline.h so that they work OK
          with g++ compilers that aren't completely up-to-date.
          If symbol COMPILER_FIXED is defined then the behavior
          that works on my more recent version of g++ is enabled.

Sun Jul  9 17:53:28 1989  Doug Schmidt  (schmidt at glacier.ics.uci.edu)

        * Changed the ./tests subdirectory Makefile so that it 
          uses $(CC) instead of gcc.

Sun Jul  2 21:52:15 1989  Doug Schmidt  (schmidt at glacier.ics.uci.edu)

        * Fixed a number of subtle bugs that occurred when -S was
          combined with various and sundry options.

        * Added the -G option, that makes the generated keyword table
          a global static variable, rather than hiding it inside
          the lookup function.  This allows other functions to directly
          access the contents in this table.

        * Added the "#" feature, that allows comments inside the keyword
          list from the input file. Comment handling takes place in readline.c.  
          This simplifies the code and reduces the number of malloc calls.
          
        * Also added the -H option (user can give the name of the hash
          function) and the -T option (prevents the transfer of the type decl
          to the output file, which is useful if the type is already defined
          elsewhere).

Thu Jun 22 20:39:39 1989  Doug Schmidt  (schmidt at glacier.ics.uci.edu)

        * Modified many classes so that they would inherit Std_Err as
          a base class.  This makes things more abstract...

Fri Jun 16 14:23:00 1989  Doug Schmidt  (schmidt at zola.ics.uci.edu)

        * Modified the -f (FAST) option.  This now takes an argument.
          The argument corresponds to the number of iterations used
          to resolve collisions.  -f 0 uses the length of the
          keyword list (which is what -f did before).  This makes
          life much easier when dealing with large keyword files.

Tue Jun  6 17:53:27 1989  Doug Schmidt  (schmidt at glacier.ics.uci.edu)

        * Added the -c (comparison) option.  Enabling this
          will use the strncmp function for string comparisons.
          The default is to use strcmp.

        * Fixed a typo in key_list.cc (PRINT_SWITCH).  This caused
          faulty C code to be generated when the -D, -p, and -t
          options were all enabled.

Thu May 25 14:07:21 1989  Doug Schmidt  (schmidt at siam.ics.uci.edu)

        * Once again, changed class Read_Line to overload global operator
          new.  Hopefully, this will work...!

Sun May 21 01:51:45 1989  Doug Schmidt  (schmidt at crimee.ics.uci.edu)

        * Modified Key_List::print_hash_function () so that it properly
          formats the associated values in the hash table according to
          the maximum number of digits required to represent the largest
          value.

        * Removed the named return value from class Hash_Table's
          operator (), since this causes a seg fault when -O is enabled.
          No sense tripping subtle g++ bugs if we don't have to.... ;-)

        * Removed the operator new hack from Read_Line, since this seemed
          to create horrible bus error problems.
                    
        * Changed many class member functions and data members to be `static', 
          if they don't manipulate this!
          
Fri May 12 23:06:56 1989  Doug Schmidt  (schmidt at glacier.ics.uci.edu)

        * Changed class Std_Err to use static member functions, a la
          Ada or Modula 2.  This eliminates the need for an explicit
          error-handler class object.

        * Added the ``named return value'' feature to Hash_Table::operator ()
          and Bool_Array::operator [], just for the heck of it.... ;-)

        * Changed the previous hack in Read_Line so that we now use
          the overloaded global `new' instead of NEW_STRING!

Wed May  3 17:36:55 1989  Doug Schmidt  (schmidt at zola.ics.uci.edu)

        * Updated to version 1.7.  This reflects the recent major changes
          and the new C port.

        * Modified the GNU getopt.cc routine to have a class-based interface.

        * Fixed a typo in Perfect.cc ~Perfect that prevented the actual maximum
          hash table size from being printed (maybe the stream classes
          weren't so bad after all.... ;-).

        * Added support for the -f option.  This generates the perfect
          hash function ``fast.''  It reduces the execution time of
          gperf, at the cost of minimizing the range of hash values.

Tue May  2 16:23:29 1989  Doug Schmidt  (schmidt at crimee.ics.uci.edu)

        * Added an efficiency hack to Read_Line.  Instead of making
          a call to operator NEW (a.k.a. malloc) for each input string
          a new member function NEW_STRING stores a large buffer from
          which new strings are carved out, growing the buffer if
          necessary.  It might be useful to add this throughout the
          program....

        * Removed all unnecessary calls to DELETE.  If the program is about
          to exit it is silly to waste time freeing memory.

        * Added the GNU getopt program to the distribution.  This makes
          GPERF portable to systems that don't include getopt in libc.
          
        * Added a strcspn member to class Key_List.  This also increases
          portability.

        * Added the get_include_src function from keylist.c as a member
          function in class Key_List.  Hopefully every function is 
          now associated with a class.  This aids abstraction and
          modularity.

        * Ported gperf to C.  From now on both K&R C and GNU G++ versions
          will be supported.  There will be two ChangeLog files, one
          for each version of the program.

Mon May  1 16:41:45 1989  Doug Schmidt  (schmidt at glacier.ics.uci.edu)

        * Fixed a bug with -k'*'.  This now prints out *all* the cases
          up to the length of the longest word in the keyword set.

Sun Apr 30 12:15:25 1989  Doug Schmidt  (schmidt at crimee.ics.uci.edu)

        * Removed all use of the stream classes.  Too ugly, slow, and
          not handled by the c++-mode formatter....

        * Modified the handling of links (i.e., keywords that have
          identical hash values as other keywords).  This should 
          speed up hash function generation for keyword sets with
          many duplicate entries.  The trick is to treat duplicate
          values as equivalence classes, so that each set of duplicate
          values is represented only once in the main list processing.

        * Fixed some capitialization typos and indentations mistakes in 
          Key_List::print_hash_function.

Sat Apr 29 12:04:03 1989  Doug Schmidt  (schmidt at zola.ics.uci.edu)

        * Fixed a typo/logico in Key_List::print_switch that prevented
          the last keyword in the keyword list to be print out.  This
          requires further examination.....

        * Fixed a stupid bug in List_Node::List_node.  If the -k'*' option
          was enabled the KEY_SET string wasn't getting terminated with
          '\0'!

Fri Apr 28 12:38:35 1989  Doug Schmidt  (schmidt at glacier.ics.uci.edu)

        * Renamed strexp.h and strexp.cc to iterator.h and iterator.cc.
          Also changed the strexp class to iterator.  Continued to work
          on style...

        * Updated the version number to 1.6.  This reflects all the 
          recent changes.

Thu Apr 27 00:14:51 1989  Doug Schmidt  (schmidt at glacier.ics.uci.edu)

        * Added the -D option that properly handles keyword sets that
          contain duplicate hash values.

        * Continued the stylistic changes.  Added the #pragma once
          directive to all the *.h files.  Removed all #defines and
          replaced them with static consts.  Also moved the key_sort
          routine from options.cc into the options class as a 
          member function.

Mon Apr  3 13:26:55 1989  Doug Schmidt  (schmidt at zola.ics.uci.edu)

        * Made massive stylistic changes to bring source code into
          conformance with GNU style guidelines.

Thu Mar 30 23:28:45 1989  Doug Schmidt  (schmidt at crimee.ics.uci.edu)

        * Fixed up the output routines so that they generate code
          corresponding to the GNU style guidelines.

Sat Mar 11 13:12:37 1989  Doug Schmidt  (schmidt at glacier.ics.uci.edu)

        * Fixed Stderr constructors so that they wouldn't try to
          use the base class initializer syntax for the static 
          class variable Program_Name.  G++ 1.34 is stricter in
          enforcing the rules!

Fri Mar 10 11:24:14 1989  Doug Schmidt  (schmidt at glacier.ics.uci.edu)

        * Removed -v and ``| more'' from the Makefile to keep rfg happy...

Thu Mar  2 12:37:30 1989  Doug Schmidt  (schmidt at crimee.ics.uci.edu)

        * Sent latest GNU gperf version 1.5 to Doug Lea for inclusion
          into libg++ 1.34.  Note that there is a small bug with
          the new %{ ... %} source inclusion facility, since it doesn't
          understand comments and will barf if %{ or %} appear nested
          inside the outermost delimiters.  This is too trivial of
          a defect to fix at the moment...

Tue Feb 28 11:19:58 1989  Doug Schmidt  (schmidt at glacier.ics.uci.edu)

        * Added the -K option, which allows the user to provide a
          alternative name for the keyword structure component.
          The default is still ``name.''

        * Added the LEX and YACC-like ability to include arbitrary
          text at the beginning of the generated C source code output.
          This required two new functions Get_Special_Input, 
          Key_List::Save_Include_Src;

        * Fixed memory allocation bug in Key_List::Set_Types.
          Variable Return_Type needs 1 additional location
          to store the "*" if the -p option is used.
          
        * Added code to NULL terminate both Struct_Tag and Return_Type,
          *after* the strncpy (stupid mistake).
          
Mon Feb 27 14:39:51 1989  Doug Schmidt  (schmidt at glacier.ics.uci.edu)

        * Added a new option -N.  This allows the user to specify the
          name to be used for the generated lookup function.  The
          default name is still ``in_word_set.''  This makes it
          possible to completely automate the perfect hash function
          generation process!

Mon Feb 20 23:33:14 1989  Doug Schmidt  (schmidt at glacier.ics.uci.edu)

        * Corrected the Hash_Table::operator () function so that
          *it* is responsible for deciding when a new key has the
          same signature as a previously seen key.  The key length 
          information is now used internally to this function to
          decide whether to add to the hash table those keys with
          the same key sets, but different lengths.  Before, this
          was handled by the Key_List::Read_Keys function.  However,
          this failed to work for certain duplicate keys, since
          they weren't being entered into the hash table properly.

Sun Feb 19 16:02:51 1989  Doug Schmidt  (schmidt at glacier.ics.uci.edu)

        * Modified class Options by moving the enum Option_Type out
          of the class.  This is to satisfy the new enumeration
          scope rules in C++.

Sun Jan 15 15:12:09 1989  Doug Schmidt  (schmidt at crimee.ics.uci.edu)

        * Incremented the version number upto 1.4 to reflect the new 
          options that affect the generated code.  Send the new 
          distribution off to Michael for use with g++ 1.33.

        * Added a fix to Key_List::Read_Keys so that it checks for links
          properly when the -n option is used.  Previously, it didn't
          catch obvious links, which caused it to spend large amount
          of time searching for a solution that could never occur!

        * Modified the Key_List data structure to record *both* the 
          minimum and the maximum key lengths.  This information
          is now computed in Key_List::Read_Keys, and thus 
          Key_List::Print_Min_Max doesn't need to bother.

        * Modifed the key position iterator scheme in options.cc to
          eliminate the need for member function Options::Advance.
          Now, the Options::Get function performs the advancement
          automatically, obviating the need for an extra function call.

        * Added the new function Options::Print_Options, to print out
          the user-specified command line options to generated C
          output file.

        * Added a new function, Key_List::Print_Keylength_Table,
          which creates a table of lengths for use in speeding
          up the keyword search.  This also meant that a new
          option, -l (LENTABLE) is recognized.  It controls 
          whether the length table is printed and the comparison
          made in the generated function ``in_word_set.''

        * Added a comment at the top of the generated C code
          output file that tells what version of gperf was used.
          Next, I'll also dump out the command line options
          as a comment too.  Thanks to Michael Tiemann for the
          feedback on this.

        * Fixed the -n option to make it work correctly with
          other parts of the program (most notably the Perfect::Hash
          function and the computation of minimum and maximum lengths.

Fri Jan 13 21:25:27 1989  Doug Schmidt  (schmidt at siam.ics.uci.edu)

        * Realized the the need to add a test that will enable
          optimziation of the generated C code in the ``hash'' function
          by checking whether all the requested key positions are
          guaranteed to exist due to the comparison in `in_word_set.''
          I'll put this in soon....

Thu Jan 12 20:09:21 1989  Doug Schmidt  (schmidt at glacier.ics.uci.edu)

        * Added pascal, modula3, and modula2 tests inputs to the 
          Makefile
        
        * Recognised that there is a bug with the -n option.  However
          I'm too busy to fix it properly, right now.  The problem 
          is that the generated #define end up being 0, since that's
          my hack to make -n work.  This needs complete rethinking!

Tue Jan 10 00:08:16 1989  Doug Schmidt  (schmidt at crimee.ics.uci.edu)

        * Added a new option, -n, that instructs gperf to not use the
          length of an identifier when computing the hash functions.
          I'm not sure how useful this is!
          
        * Retransmitted the distribution to rocky.oswego.edu.  Hopefully,
          this will work!

        * Began fixing the indentation and capitalization to conform
          to the GNU coding guidelines.

Mon Jan  9 22:23:18 1989  Doug Schmidt  (schmidt at pompe.ics.uci.edu)

        * Fixed horrible bug in Read_Line::Readln_Aux.  This was
          a subtle and pernicous off-by-1 error, that overwrote
          past the last character of the input string buffer.  I
          think this fault was killing the vax!

        * Yow, fixed an oversight in List_Node::List_Node, where the
          pointer field Next was uninitialized.  Luckily, the new routine
          seems to return 0 filled objects the first time through!

Sun Jan  8 13:43:14 1989  Doug Schmidt  (schmidt at crimee.ics.uci.edu)

        * Modified the ``key linked'' diagnostic in Key_List::Read_Keys
          to be more helpful and easy to read.

        * Fixed the List_Node::List_Node so that it would ignore trailing
          fields if the -t option was not enabled.

        * Moved the List_Node declarations out of keylist.h and
          into a file of its own, called listnode.cc and listnode.h
          Made Set_Sort a member function of class List_Node.

        * Massively updated the documentation in the gperf.texinfo file.
        
        * Polished off the major revision to the print functions,
          added a few new tests in the Makefile to check for the
          validity of the program and ftp'ed the entire distribution
          off to Doug Lea for libg++. ( changed it to
          1.3 to reflect the major changes with the generated
          C code ).

        * Fixed Key_List::Print_Switch to deal with the -p and -t options.
          This meant that the ``still-born'' function Key_List::
          Print_Type_Switch was superflous, so I removed it.
          Also, removed the restriction in Option that the -p and
          -t options couldn't be used simultaneously.

        * Modified List_Node::List_Node, to perform only 1 call to 
          ``new'' when dynamically allocating memory for the Key_Set
          and the Uniq_Set.

Sat Jan  7 14:10:51 1989  Doug Schmidt  (schmidt at glacier.ics.uci.edu)

        * Fixed a big bug with the new policy of nesting the
          wordlist inside of generated function ``in_word_set.''
          I'd forgotten to declare the wordlist array as static!
          ( arrgh ).

        * Added a new function Key_List::Set_Types, that figures out
          the return type for generated function ``in_word_set,''
          the user-defined ``struct tag,'' if one is used, and also
          formates the array type for the static local array.

        * Changed the print routines to take advantage of the
          new -p option.

        * Began adding the hooks to allow the return of a pointer
          to a user defined struct location from the generated
          ``in_word_set'' function instead of the current 0 or 1
          return value.  Created function Key_List::Print_Type_Switch
          and added option -p to class Option, allowing the user to 
          request generation of the aforementioned pointers returned 
          instead of booleans.

        * Put in checks in class Option to make sure that -S and -t
          options are not used simultaneously.  This restriction
          will be removed in subsequent releases, once I decide on
          a clean way to implement it.

        * Sent version 1.2 to Doug Lea for possible inclusion into
          the libg++ distribution.
          
        * Moved the static word_list array inside the generated function
          in_word_set.  This supports better data hiding.

        * Added a texinfo file, gperf.texinfo
          
        * Revised the Makefile to cleanup the droppings from texinfo
          and changed the name of gperf.cc and gperf.h to perfect.cc
          and perfect.h.

Fri Jan  6 13:04:45 1989  Doug Schmidt  (schmidt at crimee.ics.uci.edu)

        * Implemented the switch statement output format.  Much better
          for large datasets in terms of space used.

        * Added new functions to break up the Key_List::Output function.
          Functions added were Key_List::Print_Switch, Key_List::Print_Min_Max,
          Key_List::Print_Keyword_Table, Key_List::Print_Hash_Function,
          and Key_List::Print_Lookup_Function.  This simplifies the
          big mess in Key_List::Output considerably!
          
        * Added switch statement option to Options, which potentially 
          trades time for space in the generated lookup code.

Thu Jan  5 22:46:34 1989  Doug Schmidt  (schmidt at siam.ics.uci.edu)

        * Released version 1.1
        
        * Fixed a bug with Gperf::Merge_Set, it was skipping letters shared
          between the Set_1 and Set_2.

        * Added the optimal min/max algorithm in Key_List::Output.  This
          runs in O ( 3n/2 ), rather than O ( 2n ) time.

        * Changed Gperf::Sort_Set to use insertion sort, rather than
          bubble sort.
        
        * Added a check in Key_List::Output for the special case where
          the keys used are 1,$.  It is possible to generate more
          efficient C code in this case.
