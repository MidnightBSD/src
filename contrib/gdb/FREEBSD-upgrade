To strip down a new version of gdb for import, extract the files like this:

    tar xzf gdb-6.1.1.tar.gz -X FREEBSD-Xlist

After importing, remove files on the vendor branch that are not part of the
new gdb version (if any).  Then remove files from HEAD that are not part of
the new version (if applicable).
