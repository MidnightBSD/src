   LOCAL FUNCTION

   elf_symtab_read -- read the symbol table of an ELF file

   SYNOPSIS

   void elf_symtab_read (struct objfile *objfile, int dynamic)

   DESCRIPTION

   Given an objfile and a flag that specifies whether or not the objfile
   is for an executable or not (may be shared library for example), add
   all the global function and data symbols to the minimal symbol table.

   In stabs-in-ELF, as implemented by Sun, there are some local symbols
   defined in the ELF symbol table, which can be used to locate
   the beginnings of sections from each ".o" file that was linked to
   form the executable objfile.  We gather any such info and record it
   in data structures hung off the objfile's private data.

/* Scan and build partial symbols for a symbol file.

   in each section.  We simplify it down to a single offset for all

   MAINLINE is true if we are reading the main symbol
   table (as opposed to a shared lib or dynamically loaded file).

   This function only does the minimum work necessary for letting the
   user "name" things symbolically; it does not read the entire symtab.
   Instead, it reads the external and static symbols and puts them in partial
   symbol tables.  When more extensive information is requested of a
   file, the corresponding partial symbol table is mutated into a full
   fledged symbol table by going back and reading the symbols
   for real.

   We look for sections with specific names, to tell us what debug
   format to look for:  FIXME!!!

   dwarf_build_psymtabs() builds psymtabs for DWARF symbols;
   elfstab_build_psymtabs() handles STABS symbols;
   mdebug_build_psymtabs() handles ECOFF debugging information.

   Note that ELF files have a "minimal" symbol table, which looks a lot
   like a COFF symbol table, but has only the minimal information necessary
   for linking.  We process this also, and use the information to
   build gdb's minimal symbol table.  This gives us some minimal debugging
