.SH NAME
ipmon, ipmon.conf \- ipmon configuration file format
.SH DESCRIPTION
The format for files accepted by ipmon is described by the following grammar:
.LP
.nf
"match" "{" matchlist "}" "do" "{" doing "}" ";"

matchlist ::= matching [ "," matching ] .
matching  ::= direction | dstip | dstport | every | group | interface |
              logtag | nattag | protocol | result | rule | srcip | srcport .

dolist ::= doing [ "," doing ] .
doing  ::= execute | save | syslog .

direction ::= "in" | "out" .
dstip     ::= "dstip" "=" ipv4 "/" number .
dstport   ::= "dstport" "=" number .
every     ::= "every" every-options .
execute   ::= "execute" "=" string .
group     ::= "group" "=" string | "group" "=" number .
interface ::= "interface" "=" string .
logtag    ::= "logtag" "=" string | "logtag" "=" number .
nattag    ::= "nattag" "=" string .
protocol  ::= "protocol" "=" string | "protocol" "=" number .
result    ::= "result" "=" result-option .
rule      ::= "rule" "=" number .
srcip     ::= "srcip" "=" ipv4 "/" number .
srcport   ::= "srcport" "=" number .
type      ::= "type" "=" ipftype .
ipv4      ::= number "." number "." number "." number .

every-options ::= "second" | number "seconds" | "packet" | number "packets" .
result-option ::= "pass" | "block" | "short" | "nomatch" | "log" .
ipftype ::= "ipf" | "nat" | "state" .

In addition, lines that start with a # are considered to be comments.

.SH OVERVIEW
.PP
The ipmon configuration file is used for defining rules to be executed when
logging records are read from
.B /dev/ipl.
.PP
At present, only IPv4 matching is available for source/destination address
matching.
.SH MATCHING
.PP
Each rule for ipmon consists of two primary segments: the first describes how
the log record is to be matched, the second defines what action to take if
there is a positive match.  All entries of the rules present in the file are
compared for matches - there is no first or last rule match.
