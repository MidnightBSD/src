WORK IN PROGRESS
================

This directory contains an experimental implementation of a C++HL, a
high-level Subversion C++ API, modeled along the lines of JavaHL.

It is far from complete and may never see the light of day.

On the other hand, one good reason for having a high-level C++ API is
to use it as a baseline for Swig-generated binadings.  Our current set
of Perl, Python and Ruby bindings is too heterogenous in terms of
feature set, object and usage model. They're almost as hard to use as
the C API itself.
