# This is a hints file for DGUX, which is EMC's Data General's Unix.  It 
# was originally developed with version 5.4.3.10 of the OS, and then was
# later updated running under version 4.11.2 (running on m88k hardware).
# The gross features should work with versions going back to 2.nil but
# some tweaking will probably be necessary.
#
# DGUX is an SVR4 derivative.  It ships with gcc as the standard
# compiler.  Since version 3.0 it has shipped with Perl 4.036
# installed in /usr/bin, which is kind of neat.  Be careful when you
# install that you don't overwrite the system version, though (by
# answering yes to the question about installing perl as /usr/bin/perl),
# as it would suck to try to get support if the vendor learned that you
# were physically replacing the system binaries.
#
# -Roderick Schertler <roderick@argon.org>

# The standard system compiler is gcc, but invoking it as cc changes its
# behavior.  I have to pick one name or the other so I can get the
# dynamic loading switches right (they vary depending on this).  I'm
# picking gcc because there's no way to get at the optimization options
# and so on when you call it cc.

# DG has this thing set up with symlinks which point to different places
# depending on environment variables (see elink(5)) and the compiler and
# related tools use them to access different development environments
# (COFF, ELF, m88k BCS and so on), see sde(5).  The upshot, however, is
# that when a normal program tries to access one of these elinks it sees
# no such file (like stat()ting a mis-directed symlink).  Setting
# $plibpth to explicitly include the place to which the elinks point
# allows Configure to find libraries which vary based on the development
# environment.
#
# Starting with version 4.10 (the first time the OS supported Intel
# hardware) all libraries are accessed with this mechanism.
#
# The default $TARGET_BINARY_INTERFACE changed with version 4.10.  The
# system now comes with a link named /usr/sde/default which points to
# the proper entry, but older versions lacked this and used m88kdgux
# directly.

NOTE:  I can't figure out what SDE is used by default on this machine (I
didn't find a likely directory under $sde_path).  This is bad news.  If
this is a R4.10 or newer system I'm not going to be able to find any of
your libraries, if this system is R3.10 or older I won't be able to find
the math library.  You should re-run Configure with the environment
variable TARGET_BINARY_INTERFACE set to the proper value for this
machine, see sde(5) and the notes in hints/dgux.sh.
