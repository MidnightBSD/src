[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mMail.local [22mreads the standard input up to an end-of-file and appends it
       to each [4muser's[24m [1mmail [22mfile.  The [4muser[24m must be a valid user name.

       The options are as follows:

       [1m-7        [22mDo not advertise 8BITMIME support in LMTP mode.

       [1m-b        [22mReturn  a  permanent  error instead of a temporary error if a
                 mailbox exceeds quota.

       [1m-d        [22mSpecify this is  a  delivery  (for  backward  compatibility).
                 This option has no effect.

       [1m-D [4m[22mmbdb[24m   Specify  the  name  of  the mailbox database which is used to
                 look up local recipient names.  This option defaults to "pw",
                 which means use getpwnam().

       [1m-f [4m[22mfrom[24m   Specify the sender's name.

       [1m-l        [22mTurn on LMTP mode.

       [1m-r [4m[22mfrom[24m   Specify the sender's name (for backward compatibility).  Same
                 as -f.

       [1m-h [4m[22mfilename[0m
                 Store incoming mail in [4mfilename[24m in the user's home  directory
                 instead of a system mail spool directory.

       The  next  options  are  only available if [1mmail.local [22mhas been compiled
       with -DHASHSPOOL.

       [1m-H [4m[22mhashtypehashdepth[0m
              Select hashed mail directories.  Valid hash types are [1mu [22mfor user
              name  and  [1mm [22mfor MD5 (requires compilation with -DHASHSPOOLMD5).
              Example: [1m-H [4m[22mu2[24m selects user name hashing with a hash depth of 2.
              Note:  there  must  be  no  space  between the hash type and the
              depth.

       [1m-p [4m[22mpath[0m
              Specify an alternate mail spool path.

       [1m-n     [22mSpecify that the domain part of recipient addresses in LMTP mode
              should not be stripped.

       Individual  mail messages in the mailbox are delimited by an empty line
       followed by a line beginning with the string ``From ''.   A  line  con-
       taining  the  string  ``From  '', the sender's name and a time stamp is
       prepended to each delivered mail message.  A blank line is appended  to
       each  message.   A  greater-than  character (``>'') is prepended to any
       line in the message which could be mistaken for a ``From  ''  delimiter
       line (that is, a line beginning with the five characters ``From '' fol-
       lowing a blank line).

       The mail files are exclusively  locked  with  flock(2)  while  mail  is
       appended,  and  a  [1muser.lock  [22mfile also is created while the mailbox is
       locked for compatibility with older MUAs.

       If the ``biff'' service  is  returned  by  getservbyname(3),  the  biff
       server is notified of delivered mail.

       The [1mmail.local [22mutility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

[1mENVIRONMENT[0m
       TZ     Used to set the appropriate time zone on the timestamp.

[1mFILES[0m
       /tmp/local.XXXXXX     temporary files
       /var/mail/user        user's default mailbox directory
       /var/mail/user.lock   lock file for a user's default mailbox

[1mSEE ALSO[0m

[1mWARNING[0m
       [1mmail.local  [22mescapes  only "^From " lines that follow an empty line.  If
       all lines starting with "From " should be escaped, use the 'E' flag for
       the local mailer in the sendmail.cf file.

[1mHISTORY[0m
       A  superset  of  [1mmail.local  [22m(handling  mailbox reading as well as mail
       delivery) appeared in Version 7 AT&T UNIX as the program [1mmail[22m.
