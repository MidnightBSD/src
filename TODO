- Fix output so that tests for MIME and APPLE flags are not needed all
  over the place, and actual output is only done in one place. This
  needs a design. Suggestion: push possible outputs on to a list, then
  pick the last-pushed (most specific, one hopes) value at the end, or
  use a default if the list is empty. This should not slow down evaluation.

- Continue to squash all magic bugs. See Debian BTS for a good source.

- Store arbitrarily long strings, for example for %s patterns, so that
  they can be printed out. Fixes Debian bug #271672. Would require more
  complex store/load code in apprentice.

- Add syntax for relative offsets after current level (Debian bug #466037).

- Make file -ki work, i.e. give multiple MIME types.

- Add a zip library so we can peek inside Office2007 documents to
  figure out what they are.

- Don't complain when ~/.magic is not compiled.

- Add a separate option to print URL's for the sources of the file descriptions.
