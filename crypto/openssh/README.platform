This file contains notes about OpenSSH on specific platforms.

AIX
---
As of OpenSSH 3.8p1, sshd will now honour an accounts password expiry
settings, where previously it did not.  Because of this, it's possible for
sites that have used OpenSSH's sshd exclusively to have accounts which
have passwords expired longer than the inactive time (ie the "Weeks between
password EXPIRATION and LOCKOUT" setting in SMIT or the maxexpired
chuser attribute).

Accounts in this state must have their passwords reset manually by the
administrator.  As a precaution, it is recommended that the administrative
passwords be reset before upgrading from OpenSSH <3.8.

As of OpenSSH 4.0, configure will attempt to detect if your version
and maintenance level of AIX has a working getaddrinfo, and will use it
if found.  This will enable IPv6 support.  If for some reason configure
gets it wrong, or if you want to build binaries to work on earlier MLs
than the build host then you can add "-DBROKEN_GETADDRINFO" to CFLAGS
to force the previous IPv4-only behaviour.

IPv6 known to work: 5.1ML7 5.2ML2 5.2ML5
IPv6 known broken: 4.3.3ML11 5.1ML4

Cygwin
------
To build on Cygwin, OpenSSH requires the following packages:
gcc, gcc-mingw-core, mingw-runtime, binutils, make, openssl,
openssl-devel, zlib, minres, minires-devel.


Solaris
-------
If you enable BSM auditing on Solaris, you need to update audit_event(4)
for praudit(1m) to give sensible output.  The following line needs to be
added to /etc/security/audit_event:

	32800:AUE_openssh:OpenSSH login:lo

The BSM audit event range available for third party TCB applications is
32768 - 65535.  Event number 32800 has been choosen for AUE_openssh.
There is no official registry of 3rd party event numbers, so if this
number is already in use on your system, you may change it at build time
by configure'ing --with-cflags=-DAUE_openssh=32801 then rebuilding.
