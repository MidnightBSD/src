     introduce sandboxing of the pre-auth privsep child using systrace(4).
     
     This introduces a new "UsePrivilegeSeparation=sandbox" option for
     sshd_config that applies mandatory restrictions on the syscalls the
     privsep child can perform. This prevents a compromised privsep child
     from being used to attack other hosts (by opening sockets and proxying)
     or probing local kernel attack surface.
     
     The sandbox is implemented using systrace(4) in unsupervised "fast-path"
     mode, where a list of permitted syscalls is supplied. Any syscall not
     on the list results in SIGKILL being sent to the privsep child. Note
     that this requires a kernel with the new SYSTR_POLICY_KILL option.
     
     UsePrivilegeSeparation=sandbox will become the default in the future
     so please start testing it now.

   exact when it comes to check for problems which disallow to run
   certain aspects of the script.  So, part of this script and the also
   rearranged service helper script library "csih" is to check if all
   the tools required to run the script are available on the system.

     ECDH/ECDSA compliance fix: these methods vary the hash function they use
     (SHA256/384/512) depending on the length of the curve in use. The previous
     code incorrectly used SHA256 in all cases.
     
     This fix will cause authentication failure when using 384 or 521-bit curve
     keys if one peer hasn't been upgraded and the other has. (256-bit curve
     keys work ok). In particular you may need to specify HostkeyAlgorithms
     when connecting to a server that has not been upgraded from an upgraded

     [channels.c]
     Fix a trio of bugs in the local/remote window calculation for datagram
     data channels (i.e. TunnelForward):
     
     Calculate local_consumed correctly in channel_handle_wfd() by measuring
     the delta to buffer_len(c->output) from when we start to when we finish.
     The proximal problem here is that the output_filter we use in portable
     modified the length of the dequeued datagram (to futz with the headers
     for !OpenBSD).
     
     In channel_output_poll(), don't enqueue datagrams that won't fit in the
     peer's advertised packet size (highly unlikely to ever occur) or which
     won't fit in the peer's remaining window (more likely).
     
     In channel_input_data(), account for the 4-byte string header in
     datagram packets that we accept from the peer and enqueue in c->output.

     Pause the mux channel while waiting for reply from aynch callbacks.

     Extend channel open confirm callback to allow signalling failure

     start using the above pause mechanism and 3) delay sending a success/

     the server.

     [auth-options.c auth-options.h auth.c auth.h auth2-pubkey.c]
     [key.c servconf.c servconf.h sshd.8 sshd_config.5]
     add some optional indirection to matching of principal names listed
     in certificates. Currently, a certificate must include the a user's name
     to be accepted for authentication. This change adds the ability to
     specify a list of certificate principal names that are acceptable.
     
     When authenticating using a CA trusted through ~/.ssh/authorized_keys,
     this adds a new principals="name1[,name2,...]" key option.
     
     For CAs listed through sshd_config's TrustedCAKeys option, a new config
     option "AuthorizedPrincipalsFile" specifies a per-user file containing
     the list of acceptable names.
     
     If either option is absent, the current behaviour of requiring the
     username to appear in principals continues to apply.
     
     These options are useful for role accounts, disjoint account namespaces
     and "user@realm"-style naming policies in certificates.
