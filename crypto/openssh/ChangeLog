 - (dtucker) [contrib/cygwin/ssh-host-config] From Corinna: revamp of the
   Cygwin-specific service installer script ssh-host-config.  The actual
   functionality is the same, the revisited version is just more
   exact when it comes to check for problems which disallow to run
   certain aspects of the script.  So, part of this script and the also
   rearranged service helper script library "csih" is to check if all
   the tools required to run the script are available on the system.
   The new script also is more thorough to inform the user why the
   script failed.  Patch from vinschen at redhat com.

     keys if one peer hasn't been upgraded and the other has. (256-bit curve

     Only the mandatory sections of RFC5656 are implemented, specifically the
     three REQUIRED curves nistp256, nistp384 and nistp521 and only ECDH and

     [channels.c]
     Fix a trio of bugs in the local/remote window calculation for datagram
     data channels (i.e. TunnelForward):
     
     Calculate local_consumed correctly in channel_handle_wfd() by measuring
     the delta to buffer_len(c->output) from when we start to when we finish.
     The proximal problem here is that the output_filter we use in portable
     modified the length of the dequeued datagram (to futz with the headers
     for !OpenBSD).
     
     In channel_output_poll(), don't enqueue datagrams that won't fit in the
     peer's advertised packet size (highly unlikely to ever occur) or which
     won't fit in the peer's remaining window (more likely).
     
     In channel_input_data(), account for the 4-byte string header in
     datagram packets that we accept from the peer and enqueue in c->output.

     [key.c servconf.c servconf.h sshd.8 sshd_config.5]
     add some optional indirection to matching of principal names listed
     in certificates. Currently, a certificate must include the a user's name
     to be accepted for authentication. This change adds the ability to
     specify a list of certificate principal names that are acceptable.
     
     When authenticating using a CA trusted through ~/.ssh/authorized_keys,
     this adds a new principals="name1[,name2,...]" key option.
     
     For CAs listed through sshd_config's TrustedCAKeys option, a new config
     option "AuthorizedPrincipalsFile" specifies a per-user file containing
     the list of acceptable names.
     
     If either option is absent, the current behaviour of requiring the
     username to appear in principals continues to apply.
     
     These options are useful for role accounts, disjoint account namespaces
     and "user@realm"-style naming policies in certificates.
