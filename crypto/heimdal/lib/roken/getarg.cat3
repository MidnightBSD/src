     ggeettaarrgg() collects any command line options given to a program in an eas-
     ily used way.  aarrgg__pprriinnttuussaaggee() pretty-prints the available options, with
     a short help text.

     _a_r_g_s is the option specification to use, and it's an array of _s_t_r_u_c_t
     _g_e_t_a_r_g_s elements.  _n_u_m___a_r_g_s is the size of _a_r_g_s (in elements).  _a_r_g_c and
     _a_r_g_v are the argument count and argument vector to extract option from.
     _o_p_t_i_n_d is a pointer to an integer where the index to the last processed
     argument is stored, it must be initialised to the first index (minus one)
     to process (normally 0) before the first call.

     _a_r_g___p_r_i_n_t_u_s_a_g_e take the same _a_r_g_s and _n_u_m___a_r_g_s as getarg; _p_r_o_g_n_a_m_e is the
     name of the program (to be used in the help text), and _e_x_t_r_a___s_t_r_i_n_g is a
     string to print after the actual options to indicate more arguments. The
     usefulness of this function is realised only be people who has used pro-
     grams that has help strings that doesn't match what the code does.

     The _g_e_t_a_r_g_s struct has the following elements.

     struct getargs{
         const char *long_name;
         char short_name;
         enum { arg_integer,
                arg_string,
                arg_flag,
                arg_negative_flag,
                arg_strings,
                arg_double,
                arg_collect
         } type;
         void *value;
         const char *help;
         const char *arg_help;
     };

     _l_o_n_g___n_a_m_e is the long name of the option, it can be NULL, if you don't
     want a long name.  _s_h_o_r_t___n_a_m_e is the characted to use as short option, it
     can be zero. If the option has a value the _v_a_l_u_e field gets filled in
     with that value interpreted as specified by the _t_y_p_e field.  _h_e_l_p is a
     longer help string for the option as a whole, if it's NULL the help text
     for the option is omitted (but it's still displayed in the synopsis).
     _a_r_g___h_e_l_p is a description of the argument, if NULL a default value will
     be used, depending on the type of the option:

     arg_integer        the argument is a signed integer, and _v_a_l_u_e should
                        point to an _i_n_t.

     _a_r_g___s_t_r_i_n_g         the argument is a string, and _v_a_l_u_e should point to a
                        _c_h_a_r_*.

     _a_r_g___f_l_a_g           the argument is a flag, and _v_a_l_u_e should point to a
                        _i_n_t.  It gets filled in with either zero or one,
                        depending on how the option is given, the normal case
                        being one. Note that if the option isn't given, the
                        value isn't altered, so it should be initialised to
                        some useful default.

     _a_r_g___n_e_g_a_t_i_v_e___f_l_a_g  this is the same as _a_r_g___f_l_a_g but it reverses the mean-
                        ing of the flag (a given short option clears the
                        flag), and the synopsis of a long option is negated.

     _a_r_g___s_t_r_i_n_g_s        the argument can be given multiple times, and the val-
                        ues are collected in an array; _v_a_l_u_e should be a
                        pointer to a _s_t_r_u_c_t _g_e_t_a_r_g___s_t_r_i_n_g_s structure, which
                        holds a length and a string pointer.

     _a_r_g___d_o_u_b_l_e         argument is a double precision floating point value,
                        and _v_a_l_u_e should point to a _d_o_u_b_l_e.

     _a_r_g___c_o_l_l_e_c_t        allows more fine-grained control of the option parsing
                        process.  _v_a_l_u_e should be a pointer to a
                        _g_e_t_a_r_g___c_o_l_l_e_c_t___i_n_f_o structure:

                        typedef int (*getarg_collect_func)(int short_opt,
                                                           int argc,
                                                           char **argv,
                                                           int *optind,
                                                           int *optarg,
                                                           void *data);

                        typedef struct getarg_collect_info {
                            getarg_collect_func func;
                            void *data;
                        } getarg_collect_info;

                        With the _f_u_n_c member set to a function to call, and
                        _d_a_t_a to some application specific data. The parameters
                        to the collect function are:

                        _s_h_o_r_t___f_l_a_g non-zero if this call is via a short option
                        flag, zero otherwise

                        _a_r_g_c, _a_r_g_v the whole argument list

                        _o_p_t_i_n_d pointer to the index in argv where the flag is

                        _o_p_t_a_r_g pointer to the index in argv[*optind] where the
                        flag name starts

                        _d_a_t_a application specific data

                        You can modify _*_o_p_t_i_n_d, and _*_o_p_t_a_r_g, but to do this
                        correct you (more or less) have to know about the
                        inner workings of getarg.

                        You can skip parts of arguments by increasing _*_o_p_t_a_r_g
                        (you could implement the --zz_3 set of flags from ggzziipp
                        with this), or whole argument strings by increasing
                        _*_o_p_t_i_n_d (let's say you want a flag --cc _x _y _z to specify
                        a coordinate); if you also have to set _*_o_p_t_a_r_g to a
                        sane value.

                        The collect function should return one of
                        ARG_ERR_NO_MATCH, ARG_ERR_BAD_ARG, ARG_ERR_NO_ARG,
                        ENOMEM on error, zero otherwise.

                        For your convenience there is a function,
                        ggeettaarrgg__ooppttaarrgg(), that returns the traditional argument
                        string, and you pass it all arguments, sans data, that
                        where given to the collection function.

                        Don't use this more this unless you absolutely have
                        to.

     Option parsing is similar to what getopt uses. Short options without
     arguments can be compressed (--xxyyzz is the same as --xx --yy --zz), and short
     options with arguments take these as either the rest of the argv-string
     or as the next option (--oo_f_o_o, or --oo _f_o_o).

     Long option names are prefixed with -- (double dash), and the value with
     a = (equal), ----ffoooo==_b_a_r.  Long option flags can either be specified as
     they are (----hheellpp), or with an (boolean parsable) option (----hheellpp==_y_e_s,
     ----hheellpp==_t_r_u_e, or similar), or they can also be negated (----nnoo--hheellpp is the
     same as ----hheellpp==no), and if you're really confused you can do it multiple
     times (----nnoo--nnoo--hheellpp==_f_a_l_s_e, or even ----nnoo--nnoo--hheellpp==_m_a_y_b_e).

     It should be more flexible, so it would be possible to use other more
     complicated option syntaxes, such as what ps(1), and tar(1), uses, or the
     AFS model where you can skip the flag names as long as the options come
     in the correct order.

     Options with multiple arguments should be handled better.

     Should be integreated with SL.

     It's very confusing that the struct you pass in is called getargS.
