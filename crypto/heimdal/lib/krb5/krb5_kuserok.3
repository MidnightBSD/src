.Os HEIMDAL
.Sh NAME
.Nm krb5_kuserok
.Nd "checks if a principal is permitted to login as a user"
.Sh LIBRARY
Kerberos 5 Library (libkrb5, -lkrb5)
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In krb5.h
.Ft krb5_boolean
.Fo krb5_kuserok
.Fa "krb5_context context"
.Fa "krb5_principal principal"
.Fa "const char *user"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This function takes the name of a local
.Fa user
and checks if
.Fa principal
is allowed to log in as that user.
.Pp
The
.Fa user
may have a
.Pa ~/.k5login
file listing principals that are allowed to login as that user. If
that file does not exist, all principals with a first component
identical to the username, and a realm considered local, are allowed
access.
.Pp
The
.Pa .k5login
file must contain one principal per line, be owned by
.Fa user ,
and not be writable by group or other (but must be readable by
anyone).
.Pp
Note that if the file exists, no implicit access rights are given to
.Fa user Ns @ Ns Aq localrealm .
.Pp
Optionally, a set of files may be put in 
.Pa ~/.k5login.d ( Ns
a directory), in which case they will all be checked in the same
manner as
.Pa .k5login .
The files may be called anything, but files starting with a hash
.Dq ( # ) ,
or ending with a tilde
.Dq ( ~ )
are ignored. Subdirectories are not traversed. Note that this
directory may not be checked by other implementations.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Nm
returns
.Dv TRUE
if access should be granted,
.Dv FALSE
otherwise.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Pa ~/.k5login.d
feature appeared in Heimdal 0.7.
