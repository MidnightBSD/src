.Sh NAME
.Nm krb5_kuserok
.Nd verifies if a principal can log in as a user
.Sh LIBRARY
Kerberos 5 Library (libkrb5, -lkrb5)
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In krb5.h
.Ft krb5_boolean
.Fo krb5_kuserok 
.Fa "krb5_context context"
.Fa "krb5_principal principal"
.Fa "const char *name"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This function takes a local user
.Fa name
and verifies if
.Fa principal
is allowed to log in as that user.
.Pp
First
.Nm
check if there is a local account name
.Fa username.
If there isn't,
.Nm
returns
.Dv FALSE .
.Pp
Then
.Nm
checks if principal is the same as user@realm in any of the default
realms. If that is the case,
.Nm
returns
.Dv TRUE .
.Pp
After that it reads the file 
.Pa .k5login
(if it exists) in the users home directory and checks if
.Fa principal
is in the file.
If it does exists,
.Dv TRUE
is returned.
If neither of the above turns out to be true,
.DV FALSE
is returned.
.Pp
The
.Pa .k5login
should contain one principal per line.
