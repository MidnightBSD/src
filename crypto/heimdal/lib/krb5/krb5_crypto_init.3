.Sh LIBRARY
Kerberos 5 Library (libkrb5, -lkrb5)
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In krb5.h
.Ft krb5_error_code
.Fn krb5_crypto_init "krb5_context context" "krb5_keyblock *key" "krb5_enctype enctype" "krb5_crypto *crypto"
.Ft krb5_error_code
.Fn krb5_crypto_destroy "krb5_context context" "krb5_crypto crypto"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions are used to initialize an encryption context that can
be used to encrypt or checksum data.
.Pp
The
.Fn krb5_crypt_init
initializes the encrytion context
.Fa crypto .
The
.Fa key
parameter is the key to use for encryption, and checksums. The
encryption type to use is taken from the key, but can be overridden
with the
.Fa enctype parameter .
.Pp
.Fn krb5_crypto_destroy
frees a previously allocated encrypion context.
