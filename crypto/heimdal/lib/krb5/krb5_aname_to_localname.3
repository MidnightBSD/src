.Fn krb5_get_default_realms )
and then returns the local name of the principal.

If
.Fa name
isn't in one of the local realms and error is returned.

If size
.Fa ( lnsize )
of the local name
.Fa ( lname )

.Fn krb5_aname_to_localname
should only be use by application that implements protocols that
doesn't transport the login name and thus needs to convert a principal
to a local name.

Protocols should be designed so that the it autheticates using
Kerberos, send over the login name and then verifies in the principal
that authenticated is allowed to login and the login name.
A way to check if a user is allowed to login is using the function
.Fn krb5_kuserok .
