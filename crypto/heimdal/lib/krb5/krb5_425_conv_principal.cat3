     Converting between version 4 and version 5 principals can at best be
     described as a mess.

     A version 4 principal consists of a name, an instance, and a realm. A
     version 5 principal consists of one or more components, and a realm. In
     some cases also the first component/name will differ between version 4
     and version 5.  Furthermore the second component of a host principal will
     be the fully qualified domain name of the host in question, while the
     instance of a version 4 principal will only contain the first part (short
     hostname).  Because of these problems the conversion between principals
     will have to be site customized.

     kkrrbb55__442255__ccoonnvv__pprriinncciippaall__eexxtt() will try to convert a version 4 principal,
     given by _n_a_m_e, _i_n_s_t_a_n_c_e, and _r_e_a_l_m, to a version 5 principal. This can
     result in several possible principals, and if _f_u_n_c is non-NULL, it will
     be called for each candidate principal.  _f_u_n_c should return true if the
     principal was ``good''.  To accomplish this,
     kkrrbb55__442255__ccoonnvv__pprriinncciippaall__eexxtt() will look up the name in _k_r_b_5_._c_o_n_f.  It
     first looks in the v4_name_convert/host subsection, which should contain
     a list of version 4 names whose instance should be treated as a hostname.
     This list can be specified for each realm (in the realms section), or in
     the libdefaults section.  If the name is found the resulting name of the
     principal will be the value of this binding. The instance is then first
     looked up in v4_instance_convert for the specified realm. If found the
     resulting value will be used as instance (this can be used for special
     cases), no further attempts will be made to find a conversion if this
     fails (with _f_u_n_c).  If the _r_e_s_o_l_v_e parameter is true, the instance will
     be looked up with ggeetthhoossttbbyynnaammee().  This can be a time consuming, error
     prone, and unsafe operation.  Next a list of hostnames will be created
     from the instance and the v4_domains variable, which should contain a
     list of possible domains for the specific realm.

     On the other hand, if the name is not found in a host section, it is
     looked up in a v4_name_convert/plain binding. If found here the name will
     be converted, but the instance will be untouched.

     This list of default host-type conversions is compiled-in:

           v4_name_convert = {
                   host = {
                           ftp = ftp
                           hprop = hprop
                           imap = imap
                           pop = pop
                           rcmd = host
                           smtp = smtp
                   }
           }

     It will only be used if there isn't an entry for these names in the con-
     fig file, so you can override these defaults.

     kkrrbb55__442255__ccoonnvv__pprriinncciippaall() will call kkrrbb55__442255__ccoonnvv__pprriinncciippaall__eexxtt() with
     NULL as _f_u_n_c, and the value of v4_instance_resolve (from the libdefaults
     section) as _r_e_s_o_l_v_e.

     kkrrbb55__552244__ccoonnvv__pprriinncciippaall() basically does the opposite of
     kkrrbb55__442255__ccoonnvv__pprriinncciippaall(), it just doesn't have to look up any names, but
     will instead truncate instances found to belong to a host principal. The
     _n_a_m_e, _i_n_s_t_a_n_c_e, and _r_e_a_l_m should be at least 40 characters long.

     Since this is confusing an example is in place.

     Assume that we have the ``foo.com'', and ``bar.com'' domains that have
     shared a single version 4 realm, FOO.COM. The version 4 _k_r_b_._r_e_a_l_m_s file
     looked like:

           foo.com         FOO.COM
           .foo.com        FOO.COM
           .bar.com        FOO.COM

     A _k_r_b_5_._c_o_n_f file that covers this case might look like:

           [libdefaults]
                   v4_instance_resolve = yes
           [realms]
                   FOO.COM = {
                           kdc = kerberos.foo.com
                           v4_instance_convert = {
                                   foo = foo.com
                           }
                           v4_domains = foo.com
                   }

     With this setup and the following host table:

           foo.com
           a-host.foo.com
           b-host.bar.com
     the following conversions will be made:

           rcmd.a-host     -> host/a-host.foo.com
           ftp.b-host      -> ftp/b-host.bar.com
           pop.foo         -> pop/foo.com
           ftp.other       -> ftp/other.foo.com
           other.a-host    -> other/a-host

     The first three are what you expect. If you remove the ``v4_domains'',
     the fourth entry will result in an error (since the host ``other'' can't
     be found). Even if ``a-host'' is a valid host name, the last entry will
     not be converted, since the ``other'' name is not known to represent a
     host-type principal.  If you turn off ``v4_instance_resolve'' the second
     example will result in ``ftp/b-host.foo.com'' (because of the default
     domain). And all of this is of course only valid if you have working name
     resolving.
