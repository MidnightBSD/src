.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions change the password for a given principal.
.Pp
.Fn krb5_set_password
and
.Fa krb5_set_password_using_ccache
is the newer two of the three functions and uses a newer version of the
protocol (and falls back to the older when the newer doesn't work).
.Pp
.Fn krb5_change_password
set the password
.Fa newpasswd
for the client principal in
.Fa creds .
The server principal of creds must be
.Li kadmin/changepw .
.Pp
.Fn krb5_set_password
changes the password for the principal
.Fa targprinc ,
if
.Fa targprinc
is
.Dv NULL
the default principal in
.Fa ccache
is used.
.Pp
Both functions returns and error in
.Fa result_code
and maybe an error strings to print in
.Fa result_string .
