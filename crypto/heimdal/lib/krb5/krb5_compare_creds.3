.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn krb5_compare_creds
compares
.Fa mcreds
(usually filled in by the application)
to
.Fa creds
(most often from a credentials cache)
and return
.Dv TRUE
if they are equal.
Unless
.Va mcreds-\*[Gt]server
is
.Dv NULL ,
the service of the credentials are always compared.  If the client
name in
.Fa mcreds
is present, the client names are also compared. This function is
normally only called indirectly via
.Xr krb5_cc_retrieve_cred 3 .
.Pp
The following flags, set in
.Fa whichfields ,
affects the comparison:
.Bl -tag -width KRB5_TC_MATCH_SRV_NAMEONLY -compact -offset indent
.It KRB5_TC_MATCH_SRV_NAMEONLY
Consider all realms equal when comparing the service principal.
.It KRB5_TC_MATCH_KEYTYPE
Compare enctypes.
.It KRB5_TC_MATCH_FLAGS_EXACT
Make sure that the ticket flags are identical.
.It KRB5_TC_MATCH_FLAGS
Make sure that all ticket flags set in
.Fa mcreds
are also present  in
.Fa creds .
.It KRB5_TC_MATCH_TIMES_EXACT
Compares the ticket times exactly.
.It KRB5_TC_MATCH_TIMES
Compares only the expiration times of the creds.
.It KRB5_TC_MATCH_AUTHDATA
Compares the authdata fields.
.It KRB5_TC_MATCH_2ND_TKT
