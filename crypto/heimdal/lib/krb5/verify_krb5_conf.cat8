     vveerriiffyy__kkrrbb55__ccoonnff reads the configuration file _k_r_b_5_._c_o_n_f, or the file
     given on the command line, parses it, checking verifying that the syntax
     is not correctly wrong.

     If the file is syntactically correct, vveerriiffyy__kkrrbb55__ccoonnff tries to verify
     that the contents of the file is of relevant nature.

     Possible output from vveerriiffyy__kkrrbb55__ccoonnff include:

     <path>: failed to parse <something> as size/time/number/boolean
             Usually means that <something> is misspelled, or that it contains
             weird characters. The parsing done by vveerriiffyy__kkrrbb55__ccoonnff is more
             strict than the one performed by libkrb5, so strings that work in
             real life might be reported as bad.

     <path>: host not found (<hostname>)
             Means that <path> is supposed to point to a host, but it can't be
             recognised as one.

     <path>: unknown or wrong type
             Means that <path> is either a string when it should be a list,
             vice versa, or just that vveerriiffyy__kkrrbb55__ccoonnff is confused.

     <path>: unknown entry
             Means that <string> is not known by vveerriiffyy__kkrrbb55__ccoonnff.

     Since each application can put almost anything in the config file, it's
     hard to come up with a watertight verification process. Most of the
     default settings are sanity checked, but this does not mean that every
     problem is discovered, or that everything that is reported as a possible
     problem actually is one. This tool should thus be used with some care.

     It should warn about obsolete data, or bad practice, but currently
     doesn't.
