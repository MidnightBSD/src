.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In krb5.h
.Ft krb5_error_code
.Fn krb5_encrypt "krb5_context context" "krb5_crypto crypto" "unsigned usage" "void *data" "size_t len" "krb5_data *result"

.Fn krb5_encrypt_EncryptedData "krb5_context context" "krb5_crypto crypto" "unsigned usage" "void *data" "size_t len" "int kvno" "EncryptedData *result"
.Ft krb5_error_code
.Fn krb5_decrypt "krb5_context context" "krb5_crypto crypto" "unsigned usage" "void *data" "size_t len" "krb5_data *result"
.Ft krb5_error_code
.Fn krb5_decrypt_EncryptedData "krb5_context context" "krb5_crypto crypto" "unsigned usage" "EncryptedData *e" "krb5_data *result"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions are used to encrypt and decrypt data.
.Pp
.Fn krb5_encrypt
puts the encrypted version of
.Fa data
(of size
.Fa len )
in
.Fa result .
If the encryption type supports using derived keys,
.Fa usage
should be the appropriate key-usage.
.Fn krb5_encrypt_EncryptedData
does the same as
.Fn krb5_encrypt ,
but it puts the encrypted data in a
.Fa EncryptedData
structure instead. If
.Fa kvno
is not zero, it will be put in the
.Fa kvno field in the
.Fa EncryptedData .
.Pp
.Fn krb5_decrypt ,
and
.Fn krb5_decrypt_EncryptedData
works similarly.
