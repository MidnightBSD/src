.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions create a Kerberos 5 principal from a realm and a list
of components.
All of these functions return an allocated principal in the
.Fa principal
parameter, this should be freed with
.Fn krb5_free_principal
after use.
.Pp
The
.Dq build
functions take a
.Fa realm
and the length of the realm.  The
.Fn krb5_build_principal
and
.Fn krb5_build_principal_va
also takes a list of components (zero-terminated strings), terminated
with
.Dv NULL .
The
.Fn krb5_build_principal_ext
and
.Fn krb5_build_principal_va_ext
takes a list of length-value pairs, the list is terminated with a zero
length.
.Pp
The
.Fn krb5_make_principal
is a wrapper around
.Fn krb5_build_principal .
If the realm is
.Dv NULL ,
the default realm will be used.
.Sh BUGS
You can not have a NUL in a component. Until someone can give a good
example of where it would be a good idea to have NUL's in a component,
this will not be fixed.
