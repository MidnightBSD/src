.Nm krb5_sock_to_principal
.Nd create a service principal
.Sh LIBRARY
Kerberos 5 Library (libkrb5, -lkrb5)
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In krb5.h
.Ft krb5_error_code
.Fn krb5_sname_to_principal "krb5_context context" "const char *hostname" "const char *sname" "int32_t type" "krb5_principal *principal"
.Ft krb5_error_code
.Fn krb5_sock_to_principal "krb5_context context" "int socket" "const char *sname" "int32_t type" "krb5_principal *principal"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions create a
.Dq service
principal that can, for instance, be used to lookup a key in a keytab. For both these function the
.Fa sname
parameter will be used for the first component of the created principal. If
.Fa sname
is
.Dv NULL ,
.Dq host
will be used instead.
.Fn krb5_sname_to_principal
will use the passed
.Fa hostname
for the second component. If type
.Dv KRB5_NT_SRV_HST
this name will be looked up with
.Fn gethostbyname .
If
.Fa hostname is
.Dv NULL ,
the local hostname will be used.
.Pp
.Fn krb5_sock_to_principal
will use the
.Dq sockname
of the passed
.Fa socket ,
which should be a bound
.Dv AF_INET
socket.
