.Sh NAME
.Nm kxd
.Nd securely forward X conections
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Ar kxd
.Op Fl t
.Op Fl i
.Op Fl p Ar port
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This is the daemon for
.Nm kx .
.Pp
Options supported by
.Nm kxd :
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl t
TCP.  Normally
.Nm kxd
will only listen for X connections on a UNIX socket, but some machines
(for example, Cray) have X libraries that are not able to use UNIX
sockets and thus you need to use TCP to talk to the pseudo-xserver
created by
.Nm kxd .
This option decreases the security significantly and should only be
used when it is necessary and you have considered the consequences of
doing so.
.It Fl i
Interactive.  Do not expect to be started by
.Nm inetd ,
but allocate and listen to the socket yourself.  Handy for testing
and debugging.
.It Fl p
Port.  Listen on the port
.Ar port .
Only usable with
.Fl i .
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Put the following in
.Pa /etc/inetd.conf :
.Bd -literal
kx	stream	tcp	nowait	root	/usr/athena/libexec/kxd	kxd
