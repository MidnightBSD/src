     The kkxx program forwards an X connection from a remote client to a local
     screen through an authenticated and encrypted stream.  Options supported
     by kkxx:

     --ll      Log in on the remote the host as user _u_s_e_r_n_a_m_e.

     --kk      Do not enable keep-alives on the TCP connections.

     --dd      Do not fork. This is mainly useful for debugging.

     --tt      Listen not only on a UNIX-domain socket but on a TCP socket as
             well.

     --pp      Use the port _p_o_r_t.

     --PP      Force passive mode.

     This program is used by rrxxtteellnneett and rrxxtteerrmm and you should not need to
     run it directly.

     It connects to a kkxxdd on the host _h_o_s_t and then will relay the traffic
     from the remote X clients to the local server.  When started, it prints
     the display and Xauthority-file to be used on host _h_o_s_t and then goes to
     the background, waiting for connections from the remote kkxxdd.
