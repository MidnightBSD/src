     _/_e_t_c_/_f_t_p_u_s_e_r_s contains a list of users that should be allowed or denied
     FTP access. Each line contains a user, optionally followed by ``allow''
     (anything but ``allow'' is ignored).  The semi-user ``*'' matches any
     user.  Users that has an explicit ``allow'', or that does not match any
     line, are allowed access. Anyone else is denied access.

     Note that this is compatible with the old format, where this file con-
     tained a list of users that should be denied access.

     This will deny anyone but ``foo'' and ``bar'' to use FTP:

     foo allow
     bar allow
     *
