     The oottpppprriinntt program prints lists of OTPs.

     Use this to print out a series of one-time passwords.  You will have to
     supply the _s_e_q_u_e_n_c_e _n_u_m_b_e_r and the _s_e_e_d as arguments and then the program
     will prompt you for your pass-phrase.

     There are several different print formats.  The default is to print each
     password with six short english words.

     Options are:

     --ee      Print the passwords in ``extended'' format.  In this format a
             prefix that says ``hex:'' or ``word:'' is included.

     --ff      To choose a different _a_l_g_o_r_i_t_h_m from the default md5.  Pick any
             of: md4, md5, and sha.

     --hh      Print the passwords in hex.

     --nn      Print _c_o_u_n_t one-time passwords, starting at _s_e_q_u_e_n_c_e_-_n_u_m_b_e_r and
             going backwards. The default is 10.
