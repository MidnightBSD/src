.SH NAME
xnlock \- amusing lock screen program with message for passers-by
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xnlock
[
\fIoptions\fP
]
[
\fImessage\fP
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I xnlock
is a program that acts as a screen saver for workstations running X11.
It also "locks" the screen such that the workstation can be left
unattended without worry that someone else will walk up to it and
mess everything up.  When \fIxnlock\fP is running, a little man with
a big nose and a hat runs around spewing out messages to the screen.
By default, the messages are "humorous", but that depends on your
sense of humor.
.LP
If a key or mouse button is pressed, a prompt is printed requesting the
user's password.  If a RETURN is not typed within 30 seconds,
the little man resumes running around.
.LP
Text on the command line is used as the message.  For example:
.br
	% xnlock I\'m out to lunch for a couple of hours.
.br
Note the need to quote shell metacharacters.
.LP
In the absence of flags or text, \fIxnlock\fP displays random fortunes.
.SH OPTIONS
Command line options override all resource specifications.
All arguments that are not associated with a command line option
is taken to be message text that the little man will "say" every
once in a while.  The resource \fBxnlock.text\fP may be set to
a string.
.TP
.BI \-fn " fontname"
The default font is the first 18 point font in the \fInew century schoolbook\fP
family.  While larger fonts are recokmmended over smaller ones, any font
in the server's font list will work.  The resource to use for this option
is \fBxnlock.font\fP.
.TP
.BI \-filename "  filename"
Take the message to be displayed from the file \fIfilename\fP.
If \fIfilename\fP is not specified, \fI$HOME/.msgfile\fP is used.
If the contents of the file are changed during runtime, the most recent text
of the file is used (allowing the displayed message to be altered remotely).
Carriage returns within the text are allowed, but tabs or other control
characters are not translated and should not be used.
The resource available for this option is \fBxnlock.file\fP.
.TP
.BI \-ar
Accept root's password to unlock screen.  This option is true by
default.  The reason for this is so that someone's screen may be
unlocked by autorized users in case of emergency and the person
running the program is still out to lunch.  The resource available
for specifying this option is \fBxnlock.acceptRootPasswd\fP.
.TP
.BI \-noar
Don't accept root's password.  This option is for paranoids who
fear their peers might breakin using root's password and remove
their files anyway.  Specifying this option on the command line
overrides the \fBxnlock.acceptRootPasswd\fP if set to True.
.TP
.BI \-ip
Ignore password prompt.
The resource available for this option is \fBxnlock.ignorePasswd\fP.
.TP
.BI \-noip
Don't ignore password prompt.  This is available in order to
override the resource \fBignorePasswd\fP if set to True.
.TP
.BI -fg " color"
Specifies the foreground color.  The resource available for this
is \fBxnlock.foreground\fP.
.TP
.BI -bg " color"
Specifies the background color.  The resource available for this
is \fBxnlock.background\fP.
.TP
.BI \-rv
Reverse the foreground and background colors.
The resource for this is \fBxvnlock.reverseVideo\fP.
.TP
.BI \-norv
Don't use reverse video.  This is available to override the reverseVideo
resource if set to True.
.TP
.BI \-prog " program"
Receive message text from the running program \fIprogram\fP. If there
are arguments to \fIprogram\fP, encase them with the name of the program in
quotes (e.g. xnlock -t "fortune -o").
The resource for this is \fBxnlock.program\fP.
