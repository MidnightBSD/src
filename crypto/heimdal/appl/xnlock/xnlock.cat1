       xnlock - amusing lock screen program with message for passers-by

       _x_n_l_o_c_k  is  a program that acts as a screen saver for workstations run-
       ning X11.  It also "locks" the screen such that the workstation can  be
       left  unattended without worry that someone else will walk up to it and
       mess everything up.  When _x_n_l_o_c_k is running, a little man  with  a  big
       nose  and  a  hat  runs  around spewing out messages to the screen.  By
       default, the messages are "humorous", but that depends on your sense of
       humor.

       If a key or mouse button is pressed, a prompt is printed requesting the
       user's password.  If a RETURN is not typed within 30 seconds, the  lit-
       tle man resumes running around.

       Text on the command line is used as the message.  For example:
            % xnlock I'm out to lunch for a couple of hours.
       Note the need to quote shell metacharacters.

       In the absence of flags or text, _x_n_l_o_c_k displays random fortunes.

       Command  line  options override all resource specifications.  All argu-
       ments that are not associated with a command line option is taken to be
       message text that the little man will "say" every once in a while.  The
       resource xxnnlloocckk..tteexxtt may be set to a string.

       --ffnn _f_o_n_t_n_a_m_e
              The default font is the first 18 point font in the  _n_e_w  _c_e_n_t_u_r_y
              _s_c_h_o_o_l_b_o_o_k  family.   While  larger  fonts are recokmmended over
              smaller ones, any font in the server's font list will work.  The
              resource to use for this option is xxnnlloocckk..ffoonntt.

       --ffiilleennaammee  _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
              Take  the  message  to  be displayed from the file _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e.  If
              _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e is not specified, _$_H_O_M_E_/_._m_s_g_f_i_l_e is used.  If the  con-
              tents  of  the  file are changed during runtime, the most recent
              text of the file is used (allowing the displayed message  to  be
              altered   remotely).   Carriage  returns  within  the  text  are
              allowed, but tabs or other control characters are not translated
              and  should not be used.  The resource available for this option
              is xxnnlloocckk..ffiillee.

       --aarr    Accept root's password to unlock screen.  This option is true by
              default.  The reason for this is so that someone's screen may be
              unlocked by autorized users in case of emergency and the  person
              running  the program is still out to lunch.  The resource avail-
              able for specifying this option is xxnnlloocckk..aacccceeppttRRoooottPPaasssswwdd.

       --nnooaarr  Don't accept root's password.  This option is for paranoids  who
              fear  their peers might breakin using root's password and remove
              their files anyway.  Specifying this option on the command  line
              overrides the xxnnlloocckk..aacccceeppttRRoooottPPaasssswwdd if set to True.

       --iipp    Ignore  password prompt.  The resource available for this option
              is xxnnlloocckk..iiggnnoorreePPaasssswwdd.

       --nnooiipp  Don't ignore password prompt.  This is  available  in  order  to
              override the resource iiggnnoorreePPaasssswwdd if set to True.

       --ffgg _c_o_l_o_r
              Specifies the foreground color.  The resource available for this
              is xxnnlloocckk..ffoorreeggrroouunndd.

       --bbgg _c_o_l_o_r
              Specifies the background color.  The resource available for this
              is xxnnlloocckk..bbaacckkggrroouunndd.

       --rrvv    Reverse  the foreground and background colors.  The resource for
              this is xxvvnnlloocckk..rreevveerrsseeVViiddeeoo.

       --nnoorrvv  Don't use reverse video.  This  is  available  to  override  the
              reverseVideo resource if set to True.

       --pprroogg _p_r_o_g_r_a_m
              Receive  message text from the running program _p_r_o_g_r_a_m. If there
              are arguments to _p_r_o_g_r_a_m, encase them with the name of the  pro-
              gram  in quotes (e.g. xnlock -t "fortune -o").  The resource for
              this is xxnnlloocckk..pprrooggrraamm.
