This kerberized popper was based on popper-1.831beta
which was later announced as "offical" and not beta.

This program is able to talk both the pop3 and the kpop3 protocol.

Please note that the server principal is pop.hostname and not
rcmd.hostname. I.e an additional entry is needed in your mailhub's
/etc/srvtab. Use ksrvutil to add the extra prinicpal.

The server is usually started from inetd and there is already an entry
for that in inetd.conf.changes.
