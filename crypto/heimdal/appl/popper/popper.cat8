     ppooppppeerr serves mail via the Post Office Protocol.  Supported options
     include:

     --aa _p_l_a_i_n_t_e_x_t|_o_t_p|_s_a_s_l
             Tells ppooppppeerr which authentication mode is acceptable, _s_a_s_l
             enables SASL (RFC2222),  and _o_t_p enables OTP (RFC1938) authenti-
             cation. Both disable plaintext passwords.

     ----aaddddrreessss--lloogg==_f_i_l_e
             Logs the addresses (along with a timestamp) of all clients to the
             specified file. This can be used to implement POP-before-SMTP
             authentication.

     --dd      Enables more verbose log messages.

     --ii      When not started by inetd, this flag tells ppooppppeerr that it has to
             create a socket by itself.

     --kk      Tells ppooppppeerr to use Kerberos for authentication. This is the tra-
             ditional way of doing Kerberos authentication, and is normally
             done on a separate port (as it doesn't follow RFC1939), and
             should be used instead of using SASL.

     --pp _p_o_r_t
             Port to listen to, in combination with --ii.

     --tt _f_i_l_e
             Trace all commands to file.

     --TT _s_e_c_o_n_d_s
             Set timeout to something other than the default of 120 seconds.

     The server was initially developed at the University of California,
     Berkeley.

     Many changes have been made as part of the KTH Kerberos distributions.
