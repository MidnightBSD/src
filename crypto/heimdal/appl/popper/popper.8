.Nd POP3 server
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl k
.Op Fl a Ar plaintext Ns \*(Ba Ns Ar otp Ns \*(Ba Ns Ar sasl
.Op Fl t Ar file
.Op Fl T Ar seconds
.Op Fl d
.Op Fl i
.Op Fl p Ar port
.Op Fl Fl address-log= Ns Pa file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
serves mail via the Post Office Protocol.  Supported options include:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a Ar plaintext Ns \*(Ba Ns Ar otp Ns \*(Ba Ns Ar sasl
Tells
.Nm
which authentication mode is acceptable,
.Ar sasl
enables SASL (RFC2222),  and
.Ar otp
enables OTP (RFC1938) authentication. Both disable plaintext passwords.
.It Fl Fl address-log= Ns Pa file
Logs the addresses (along with a timestamp) of all clients to the
specified file. This can be used to implement POP-before-SMTP
authentication.
.It Fl d
Enables more verbose log messages.
.It Fl i
When not started by inetd, this flag tells
.Nm
that it has to create a socket by itself.
.It Fl k
Tells
.Nm
to use Kerberos for authentication. This is the traditional way of
doing Kerberos authentication, and is normally done on a separate port
(as it doesn't follow RFC1939), and should be used instead of using
SASL.
.It Fl p Ar port
Port to listen to, in combination with
.Fl i .
.It Fl t Ar file
Trace all commands to file.
.It Fl T Ar seconds
Set timeout to something other than the default of 120 seconds.
