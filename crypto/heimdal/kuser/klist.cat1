     kklliisstt reads and displays the current tickets in the credential cache
     (also known as the ticket file).

     Options supported:

     --cc _c_a_c_h_e, ----ccaacchhee==_c_a_c_h_e
             credential cache to list

     --ss, --tt, ----tteesstt
             Test for there being an active and valid TGT for the local realm
             of the user in the credential cache.

     --TT, ----ttookkeennss
             display AFS tokens

     --55, ----vv55
             display v5 cred cache (this is the default)

     --ff      Include ticket flags in short form, each character stands for a
             specific flag, as follows:
                   F    forwardable
                   f    forwarded
                   P    proxiable
                   p    proxied
                   D    postdate-able
                   d    postdated
                   R    renewable
                   I    initial
                   i    invalid
                   A    pre-authenticated
                   H    hardware authenticated
