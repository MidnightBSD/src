heimdal (0.7.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version. Includes security fixes. Changes from upstream:

        * Fix security problem in rshd that enable an attacker to overwrite
          and change ownership of any file that root could write
          (CVE-2006-0582).

        * Fix a DOS in telnetd. The attacker could force the server to crash
          in a NULL de-reference before the user logged in, resulting in inetd
          turning telnetd off because it forked too fast (CVE-2006-0677).

        * Make gss_acquire_cred(GSS_C_ACCEPT) check that the requested name
          exists in the keytab before returning success. This allows servers
          to check if its even possible to use GSSAPI.

        * Fix receiving end of token delegation for GSS-API. It still wrongly
          uses subkey for sending for compatibility reasons, this will change
          in 0.8.

        * telnetd, login and rshd are now more verbose in logging failed and
          successful logins.

        * Bug fixes.

  * Ditch dbs build system in preference for quilt and cdbs.

  * Don't install /usr/include/ss. It's not included by any other header
    in heimdal-dev and is provided by ss-dev. Closes: #349213.

  * Also remove /usr/bin/mk_cmds which is also provided by ss-dev.

  * Supply /etc/ldap/schema/hdb.schema. Closes: #355287.

  * Move iprop man pages from heimdal-clients package into
    heimdal-kdc package. Closes: #347555.

  * Change default program for krsh from rlogin to ktelnet if no parameters
    given.  Closes: #355080.

heimdal (0.2l-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Move man pages into proper packages.
  * heimdal-servers now conflicts and provides ftpd.
    (closes: #54818).
  * Problems believed to already be fixed. closes: #54792.
  * heimdal-lib postrm: add -f parameter to rm so that it will not
    fail if the file doesn't exist. closes: #54847.
  * Rename telnet and ftp to ktelnet and kftp respectively.
  * Use update-alternatives for ftp and telnet.
    (note rxtelnet still uses telnet, not ktelnet).

heimdal (0.2j-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream source.
  * Improved debconf support, using setconfig helper program.
  * setconfig may not parse all valid configuration files correctly.
    Patches welcome!
  * Moved /usr/bin/login to /usr/lib/heimdal-servers/login, as I
    suspect this will help porting to the Hurd, if/when anyone tries.
  * kdc now supports (and requires) logrotate.
  * kdc tested and now works with minimal configuration.
  * heimdal-kdc does not support dpkg-reconfigure (not sure how to
    reconfigure without deleting existing setup first).
