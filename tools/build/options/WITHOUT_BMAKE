Set to not build and install the portable BSD make (bmake) as
.Xr make 1
instead of the traditional FreeBSD make.
This build option is temporary.
It allows developers to switch to the traditional FreeBSD make in order to
work out any remaining kinks or issues.
This option will be removed in due time.
