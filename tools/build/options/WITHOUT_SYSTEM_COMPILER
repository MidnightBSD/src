.\" $FreeBSD: stable/11/tools/build/options/WITHOUT_SYSTEM_COMPILER 300354 2016-05-21 01:32:23Z bdrewery $
Set to not opportunistically skip building a cross-compiler during the
bootstrap phase of the build.
Normally, if the currently installed compiler matches the planned bootstrap
compiler type and revision, then it will not be built.
This does not prevent a compiler from being built for installation though,
only for building one for the build itself.
The
.Va WITHOUT_CLANG
and
.Va WITHOUT_GCC
options control those.
