# Test that we can replace the shell and set all the shell parameters
# (except meta and builtin which have their own test). This is done by
# using a shell script for the shell that echoes all command line
# arguments and its standard input. The shell name should not be one of
# the builtin shells.
#
# XXX There seems to be a problem here in -j1 mode: for the line without
# @- make should switch on echoing again, but it doesn't.
