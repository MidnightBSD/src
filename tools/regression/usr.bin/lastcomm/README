To create the files for regression testing do the following.

1. Run values.sh for a given architecture and accounting version.
2. Unpack the generated file and rename acct into VERSION-ARCH.acct.
3. Run lastcomm -cuseS -f VERSION-ARCH-acct.in |
   awk '{$4 = ""; print}' >VERSION-ARCH.out.
4. Compare the reported values in VERSION-ARCH.out against the
   *.time values found in the file that values.sh generated.
