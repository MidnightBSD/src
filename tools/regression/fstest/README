$FreeBSD: release/7.0.0/tools/regression/fstest/README 166289 2007-01-28 00:10:28Z pjd $

Few notes on how to use fstest in short steps:

	# cd fstest
	# vi tests/conf
	Change 'fs' to file system type you want to test (UFS or ZFS).
	# vi Makefile
	You need to manually tweak few things by editing CFLAGS lines
	at the top of the file.
	# make
	It will compile fstest utility which is used by regression tests.
	# cd /path/to/file/system/you/want/to/test/
	# prove -r /path/to/fstest/

That's all. Enjoy.

Currently supported operating systems: FreeBSD, Solaris.
Currently supported file system types: UFS, ZFS.
