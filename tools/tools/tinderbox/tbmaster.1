.Sh NAME
.Nm tbmaster
.Nd manage tinderbox runs
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op options
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
script manages
.Xr tinderbox 1
runs, generates log summaries, and mails out failure reports.
.Pp
The following options are recognized:
.Bl -tag -width 12n
.It Fl a , Fl -abbreviate
Abbreviate path names in the log file.
Every occurrence of the source directory will be replaced with
.Dq /src ,
and every occurrence of the object directory with
.Dq /obj .
The resulting output should be exactly the same as if the source and
object directories really were
.Pa /src
and
.Pa /obj ,
respectively.
.It Fl c Ar NAME , Fl -config Ns = Ns Ar NAME
The name of the configuration to use.
If specified multiple times, all listed configurations will be run in
sequence.
The default value is the hostname minus the domain part.
.It Fl d , Fl -dump
Dumps the configuration and exits without running the tinderbox.
.It Fl e Ar DIR , Fl -etcdir Ns = Ns Ar DIR
The directory where configuration files are located.
The default value is
.Pa $HOME/etc .
.It Fl l Ar FILE
The name of a file to lock upon startup.
If the lock is already held by another process,
.Nm
will terminate immediately rather than block.
.It Fl n Ar ncpu
The number of concurrent jobs to run.
The default value is the number of CPUs in the machine, or 1 if that
number could not be determined.
.El
.Ss Configuration
The
.Nm
script uses named configurations located in individual files named for
the setup they describe, with a
.Pa .rc
suffix.
For instance, the
.Dq snoosnoo
configuration is contained in
.Pa snoosnoo.rc .
.Pp
In addition,
.Nm
attempts to read
.Pa default.rc
and
.Pa site.rc
before reading the actual configuration file; thus, these files may be
used to specify default values shared by multiple configurations.
.Pp
The configuration consists of a list of single- or multiple-value
variable assignments:
.Bl -tag
.It Va single_variable = Ar value
.It Va multi_variable = Ar value1 , Ar value2 , ...
.It Va multi_variable += Ar value3 , ...
.El
.Pp
Whitespace around the equal sign and around the commas separating
multiple values is optional.
.Pp
Blank lines are ignored, as is anything following a hash sign
.Pq Dq # .
.Pp
The following configuration variables are defined:
.Bl -tag -width 12n
.It ARCH
.Pq Vt single
The architecture currently being built for.
Read-only.
.It BRANCH
.Pq Vt single
The branch currently being built.
Read-only.
.It BRANCHES
.Pq Vt multiple
A list of source branches to build.
The default value is
.Dq HEAD .
.It CFLAGS
.Pq Vt single
The desired value for the
.Va CFLAGS
.Xr make 1
variable.
This is equivalent to specifying
.Va CFLAGS
in
.Va ENV .
No default value.
.It COPTFLAGS
.Pq Vt single
The desired value for the
.Va COPTFLAGS
.Xr make 1
variable.
This is equivalent to specifying
.Va COPTFLAGS
in
.Va ENV .
No default value.
.It COMMENT
.Pq Vt single
A terse comment describing the setup.
No default value.
.It CVSUP
.Pq Vt single
The name of the
.Xr cvsup 1
server to use.
No default value.
.It ENV
.Pq Vt multiple
A list of environment variables to pass to the
.Xr tinderbox 1
script.
Each value is the name and value of an environment variable, separated
by an equal sign
.Pq Dq = .
No default value.
.It HOME
.Pq Vt single
The current user's home directory, as specified by the
.Ev HOME
environment variable.
Note that it will not be defined unless it passes some simple sanity
checks.
Read-only.
.It HOSTNAME
.Pq Vt single
The name of the host running the tinderbox.
This defaults to the name reported by the
.Fl n
option of the
.Xr uname 1
command, and is only used for cosmetic purposes.
.It JOBS
The maximum number of concurrent
.Xr make 1
jobs to run.
No default value.
.It LOGDIR
.Pq Vt single
The location of the log directory.
The default value is
.Pa %%SANDBOX%%/logs .
.It MACHINE
.Pq Vt single
The machine currently being built for.
Read-only.
.It OBJDIR
.Pq Vt single
The object directory.
There is no default value; see the
.Xr tinderbox 1
script's
.Fl -objdir
option for details.
.It OPTIONS
.Pq Vt multiple
A list of additional options to pass to the
.Xr tinderbox 1
script.
No default value.
.It PATCH
.Pq Vt single
The file name (either absolute, or relative to the sandbox directory)
of the patch to apply if the
.Dq patch
command is specified.
No default value.
.It PLATFORMS
.Pq Vt multiple
Which architectures and machines to build for.
Each value is the name of an architecture, optionally followed by a
forward slash
.Pq Dq /
and a machine name.
If the machine name is not specified, it is assumed to be identical to
the architecture name.
The default value is
.Dq i386 .
.It RECIPIENT
.Pq Vt multiple
The addresses to which failure reports should be mailed.
The default value is
.Dq %%SENDER%% .
.Pp
To avoid unintentional spamming,
.Nm
will strip recipients in the
.Li freebsd.org
domain from this list unless the correct magic sauce is used.
.It REPOSITORY
.Pq Vt single
The location of the
.Xr cvs 1
repository.
No default value.
.It SANDBOX
.Pq Vt single
The location of the sandbox directory.
The default value is
.Pa /tmp/tinderbox .
.It SENDER
.Pq Vt single
The envelope sender to use when mailing out failure reports.
This should be a single email address.
No default value.
.It SRCDIR
.Pq Vt single
The source directory.
There is no default value; see the
.Xr tinderbox 1
script's
.Fl -srcdir
option for details.
.Pp
Normally, a separate directory within the sandbox will be used for
each build.
Using a shared source directory for all builds reduces disk space
requirements and speeds up the build.
Note that it is generally not a good idea to combine this with any of
the
.Dq clean ,
.Dq cleansrc
or
.Dq update
targets.
.It SUBJECT
.Pq Vt single
The subject to use on failure reports.
The default value is
.Dq Tinderbox failure on %%arch%%/%%machine%% .
.It SVNBASE
.Pq Vt single
The URL to the base of the Subversion repository.
.It TARGETS
.Pq Vt multiple
A list of targets (commands) to pass to the
.Xr tinderbox 1
script.
The default value is
.Dq update, world .
.It TIMEOUT
.Pq Vt single
The number of seconds after which each tinderbox invocation will time
out.
No default value.
.It TINDERBOX
.Pq Vt single
The location of the
.Xr tinderbox 1
script.
The default value is
.Dq %%HOME%%/bin/tinderbox .
.It URLBASE
.Pq Vt single
If defined, a URL constructed by appending the file name of the full
log file to the expanded value of this variable will be included in
failure reports.
There is no default value.
.El
.Ss Variable Substitution
All configuration variables are subject to variable substitution
immediately before use:
.Bl -bullet
.It
If a single-value variable contains substrings of the form
.Va %%VAR%%
or
.Va %%var%% ,
those substrings are replaced with the values of the corresponding
variables, after recursive substitution.
The difference between the first and the second form is that the
latter is converted to lower-case before use.
For instance,
.Dq %%BRANCH%%
might expand to
.Dq RELENG_4
while
.Dq %%branch%%
would expand to
.Dq releng_4 .
.It
If an element of a multiple-value variable is of the form
.Va %%VAR%%
or
.Va %%var%%
and the corresponding variable is a multiple-value variable, recursive
substitution is first performed on that variable, and the resulting
values are included individually in the result.
.It
Otherwise, elements of multiple-value variables are expanded
individually according to the same rules as single-value variables.
