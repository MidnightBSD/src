The TestFloat releases parallel those of SoftFloat, on which TestFloat is
based.  Each TestFloat release also incorporates all bug fixes from the
corresponding release of SoftFloat.

Release 2 (1997 June)

-- Integrated the generation of test cases and the checking of system
   results into a single program.  (Before they were separate programs,
   normally joined by explicit command-line pipes.)

-- Improved the sequence of test cases.

-- Added support for testing extended double precision and quadruple
   precision.

-- Made program output more readable, and added new command arguments.

-- Reduced dependence on the quality of the standard `random' function for
   generating test cases.  (Previously naively expected `random' to be able
   to generate good random bits for the entire machine word width.)

-- Created `testsoftfloat', with its own simpler complete software floating-
   point (``slowfloat'') for comparison purposes.

-- Made some changes to the source file structure, including renaming
   `environment.h' to `milieu.h' (to avoid confusion with environment
   variables).

Release 1a (1996 July)

-- Added the `-tininessbefore' and `-tininessafter' options to control
   whether tininess should be detected before or after rounding.
