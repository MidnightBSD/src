#####################################################################
# NETWORKING OPTIONS

#
# DEVICE_POLLING adds support for mixed interrupt-polling handling
# of network device drivers, which has significant benefits in terms
# of robustness to overloads and responsivity, as well as permitting
# accurate scheduling of the CPU time between kernel network processing
# and other activities.  The drawback is a moderate (up to 1/HZ seconds)
# potential increase in response times.
# It is strongly recommended to use HZ=1000 or 2000 with DEVICE_POLLING
# to achieve smoother behaviour.
# Additionally, you can enable/disable polling at runtime with help of
# the ifconfig(8) utility, and select the CPU fraction reserved to
# userland with the sysctl variable kern.polling.user_frac
# (default 50, range 0..100).
#
# Not all device drivers support this mode of operation at the time of
# this writing.  See polling(4) for more details.

# CLOCK OPTIONS

# The following options are used for debugging clock behavior only, and
# should not be used for production systems.

# CLK_CALIBRATION_LOOP causes clock calibration to be run in a loop at
# startup until the user presses a key.  (The i8254 clock is always
# calibrated relative to the RTC (mc146818a) and this option causes the
# calibration to be repeated.)

# CLK_USE_I8254_CALIBRATION causes the calibrated frequency of the i8254
# clock to actually be used.

# MISCELLANEOUS DEVICES AND OPTIONS

# 
# sio: serial ports (see sio(4)), including support for various
#      PC Card devices, such as Modem and NICs
#
device		sio
hint.sio.0.at="isa"
hint.sio.0.port="0x3F8"
hint.sio.0.flags="0x10"
hint.sio.0.irq="4"

# `flags' specific to sio(4).
#	0x10	enable console support for this unit.  Other console flags
#		(if applicable) are ignored unless this is set.  Enabling
#		console support does not make the unit the preferred console.
#		Boot with -h or set boot_serial=YES in the loader.  For sio(4)
#		specifically, the 0x20 flag can also be set (see above).
#		Currently, at most one unit can have console support; the
#		first one (in config file order) with this flag set is
#		preferred.  Setting this flag for sio0 gives the old behaviour.
#	0x20	force this unit to be the console (unless there is another
#		higher priority console).  This replaces the COMCONSOLE option.
#	0x40	reserve this unit for low level console operations.  Do not
#		access the device in any normal way.
#	0x80	use this port for serial line gdb support in ddb.  Also known
#		as debug port.
# PnP `flags'
#	0x1	disable probing of this device.  Used to prevent your modem
#		from being attached as a PnP modem.
# Other flags for sio that aren't documented in the man page.
#	0x20000	enable hardware RTS/CTS and larger FIFOs.  Only works for
#		ST16650A-compatible UARTs.

# Options for sio:
options 	COM_ESP			# Code for Hayes ESP.
options 	COM_MULTIPORT		# Code for some cards with shared IRQs.
options 	CONSPEED=115200		# Speed for serial console
					# (default 9600).

# HARDWARE BUS CONFIGURATION

#
# ISA bus
#
device		isa

#
# Options for `isa':
#
# AUTO_EOI_1 enables the `automatic EOI' feature for the master 8259A
# interrupt controller.  This saves about 0.7-1.25 usec for each interrupt.
# This option breaks suspend/resume on some portables.
#
# AUTO_EOI_2 enables the `automatic EOI' feature for the slave 8259A
# interrupt controller.  This saves about 0.7-1.25 usec for each interrupt.
# Automatic EOI is documented not to work for for the slave with the
# original i8259A, but it works for some clones and some integrated
# versions.
#
# MAXMEM specifies the amount of RAM on the machine; if this is not
# specified, FreeBSD will first read the amount of memory from the CMOS
# RAM, so the amount of memory will initially be limited to 64MB or 16MB
# depending on the BIOS.  If the BIOS reports 64MB, a memory probe will
# then attempt to detect the installed amount of RAM.  If this probe
# fails to detect >64MB RAM you will have to use the MAXMEM option.
# The amount is in kilobytes, so for a machine with 128MB of RAM, it would
# be 131072 (128 * 1024).
#
# BROKEN_KEYBOARD_RESET disables the use of the keyboard controller to
# reset the CPU for reboot.  This is needed on some systems with broken
# keyboard controllers.
