/*
 * Service Access Point (SAP)
 *
 * A SAP specifies the definition of an interface used between two adjacent
 * layers.  The SAP is named for the services the lower layer provides to 
 * the upper layer.
 *
 * The types of SAPs used are:
 * 	Stack - defines the interfaces between stack service entities.
 *		These are further divided into:
 *
 *		Stack class SAP - which identifies the type of interface
 *			used.  All SAPs of a particular class will provide
 *			the same interface services to the higher layer.
 *			All stack command codes are constructed using class
 *			SAP values.
 *
 *		Stack instance SAP - which identifies the specific identity
 *			of the layer providing the class interface.
