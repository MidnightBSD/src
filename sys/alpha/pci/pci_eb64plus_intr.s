/*
 * This file hacked from pci_eb164_intr.s
 *
 * These functions were written by disassembling a Digital UNIX kernel's
 * eb64p_intrdsabl and eb64p_intrenabl functions (because they had
 * interesting names, and looked like the eb164 versions which were
 * known to already work), and then playing with them to see how to call
 * them correctly.
 *
 * It looks like the right thing to do is to call them with the interrupt
 * request that you want to enable or disable (presumably in the range
 * 0 -> 23, since there are 3 8-bit interrupt-enable bits in the
 * interrupt mask PLD).
