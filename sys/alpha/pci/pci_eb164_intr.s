/*
 * The description of how to enable and disable interrupts in the
 * AlphaPC 164 motherboard technical reference manual is incorrect,
 * at least for the OSF/1 PALcode.
 *
 * These functions were written by disassembling a Digital UNIX kernel's
 * eb164_intrdsabl and eb164_intrenabl functions (because they had
 * interesting names), and then playing with them to see how to call
 * them correctly.
 *
 * It looks like the right thing to do is to call them with the interrupt
 * request that you want to enable or disable (presumably in the range
 * 0 -> 23, since there are 3 8-bit interrupt-enable bits in the
 * interrupt mask PLD).
