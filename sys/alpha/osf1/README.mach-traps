Some Alpha AXP OSF/1 binaries directly use the facilities provided by
the Mach kernel that is the basis for OSF/1.  These include (but are
surely not limited to) 'dd', 'ps', and 'w'.

Invariably, the symptom that these binaries display is that they crash
with an "unimplemented system call" trap (SIGSYS signal) for a syscall
that has a negative number.  In general, binaries that use the Mach
syscalls appear to invoke task_self() as their first syscall.

The name, number, and number of arguments for each Mach syscall is
given below; this information was gleaned by looking through the OSF/1
libmach.a's object files with dbx, then double-checked against the
contents of OSF/1's <mach/syscall_sw.h>.

These calls would be very difficult to implement properly in the
OSF/1 emulation code; by its very nature, NetBSD is not Mach, and we
don't and can't provide the underlying facilities that it does.
