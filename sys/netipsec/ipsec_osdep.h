/*
 *  1. KASSERT and spl differences 
 *
 * FreeBSD takes an expression and  parenthesized printf() argument-list.
 * NetBSD takes one arg: the expression being asserted.
 * FreeBSD's SPLASSERT() takes an SPL level as 1st arg and a
 * parenthesized printf-format argument list as the second argument.
 *
 * This difference is hidden by two 2-argument macros and one 1-arg macro:
 *    IPSEC_ASSERT(expr, msg)
 *    IPSEC_SPLASSERT(spl, msg)
 * One further difference is the spl names:
 *    NetBSD splsoftnet equates to FreeBSD splnet;
 *    NetBSD splnet equates to FreeBSD splimp.
 * which is hidden by the macro IPSEC_SPLASSERT_SOFTNET(msg).

/*
 * Differences that we don't attempt to hide:
 *
 * A. Initialization code.  This  is the largest difference of all.
 *
 *   FreeBSD uses compile/link-time perl hackery to generate special 
 * .o files  with linker sections  that give the moral equivalent of
 * C++ file-level-object constructors. NetBSD has no such facility.
 *
 * Either we implement it (ideally, in a way that can emulate
 * FreeBSD's SYSINIT() macros), or we must take other means
 * to have the per-file init functions called at some appropriate time.
 *
 * In the absence of SYSINIT(), all the file-level init functions
 * now have "extern" linkage. There is a new fast-ipsec init()
 * function which calls each of the per-file in an appropriate order. 
 * init_main will arrange to call the fast-ipsec init function
 * after the crypto framework has registered its transforms (including
 * any autoconfigured hardware crypto  accelerators) but before
 * initializing the network stack to send or receive  packet.
 *
 * B. Protosw() differences. 
 * CSRG-style BSD TCP/IP uses a generic protocol-dispatch-function
 * where the specific request is identified by an enum argument.
 * FreeBSD replaced that with an array of request-specific
 * function pointers.
 *
 * These differences affect the handlers for key-protocol user requests
 * so pervasively that I gave up on the fast-ipsec code, and re-worked the
 * NetBSD KAME code to match the (relative few) API differences
 * between NetBSD and FreeBSD's KAME netkey, and Fast-IPsec netkey.
 *
 * C. Timeout() versus callout(9):
 * The FreeBSD 4.x netipsec/ code still uses timeout().
 * FreeBSD 4.7 has callout(9), so I just replaced 
 * timeout_*() with the nearest callout_*() equivalents,
 * and added a callout handle to the ipsec context.
 *
 * D. SPL name differences.
 * FreeBSD splnet() equates directly to NetBSD's splsoftnet();
 * FreeBSD uses splimp() where (for networking) NetBSD would use splnet().
