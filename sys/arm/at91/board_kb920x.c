	 * Since the USART supports RS-485 multidrop mode, it allows the
	 * TX pins to float.  However, for RS-232 operations, we don't want
	 * these pins to float.  Instead, they should be pulled up to avoid
	 * mismatches.  Linux does something similar when it configures the
	 * TX lines.  This implies that we also allow the RX lines to float
	 * rather than be in the state they are left in by the boot loader.
	 * Since they are input pins, I think that this is the right thing
	 * to do.
