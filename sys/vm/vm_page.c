/*
 *			GENERAL RULES ON VM_PAGE MANIPULATION
 *
 *	- a pageq mutex is required when adding or removing a page from a
 *	  page queue (vm_page_queue[]), regardless of other mutexes or the
 *	  busy state of a page.
 *
 *	- a hash chain mutex is required when associating or disassociating
 *	  a page from the VM PAGE CACHE hash table (vm_page_buckets),
 *	  regardless of other mutexes or the busy state of a page.
 *
 *	- either a hash chain mutex OR a busied page is required in order
 *	  to modify the page flags.  A hash chain mutex must be obtained in
 *	  order to busy a page.  A page's flags cannot be modified by a
 *	  hash chain mutex if the page is marked busy.
 *
 *	- The object memq mutex is held when inserting or removing
 *	  pages from an object (vm_page_insert() or vm_page_remove()).  This
 *	  is different from the object's main mutex.
 *
 *	Generally speaking, you have to be aware of side effects when running
 *	vm_page ops.  A vm_page_lookup() will return with the hash chain
 *	locked, whether it was able to lookup the page or not.  vm_page_free(),
 *	vm_page_cache(), vm_page_activate(), and a number of other routines
 *	will release the hash chain mutex for you.  Intermediate manipulation
 *	routines such as vm_page_flag_set() expect the hash chain to be held
 *	on entry and the hash chain will remain held on return.
 *
 *	pageq scanning can only occur with the pageq in question locked.
 *	We have a known bottleneck with the active queue, but the cache
 *	and free queues are actually arrays already.
