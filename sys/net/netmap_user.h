 * This header contains the macros used to manipulate netmap structures
 * and packets in userspace. See netmap(4) for more information.
 *
 * The address of the struct netmap_if, say nifp, is computed from the
 * value returned from ioctl(.., NIOCREG, ...) and the mmap region:
 *	ioctl(fd, NIOCREG, &req);
 *	mem = mmap(0, ... );
 *	nifp = NETMAP_IF(mem, req.nr_nifp);
 *		(so simple, we could just do it manually)
 *
 * From there:
 *	struct netmap_ring *NETMAP_TXRING(nifp, index)
 *	struct netmap_ring *NETMAP_RXRING(nifp, index)
 *		we can access ring->nr_cur, ring->nr_avail, ring->nr_flags
 *
 *	ring->slot[i] gives us the i-th slot (we can access
 *		directly plen, flags, bufindex)
 *
 *	char *buf = NETMAP_BUF(ring, index) returns a pointer to
 *		the i-th buffer
 *
 * Since rings are circular, we have macros to compute the next index
 *	i = NETMAP_RING_NEXT(ring, i);
