 * --- Netmap data structures ---
 *
 * The data structures used by netmap are shown below. Those in
 * capital letters are in an mmapp()ed area shared with userspace,
 * while others are private to the kernel.
 * Shared structures do not contain pointers but only memory
 * offsets, so that addressing is portable between kernel and userspace.

 * The private descriptor ('softc' or 'adapter') of each interface
 * is extended with a "struct netmap_adapter" containing netmap-related
 * info (see description in dev/netmap/netmap_kernel.h.
 * Among other things, tx_rings and rx_rings point to the arrays of
 * "struct netmap_kring" which in turn reache the various
 * "struct netmap_ring", shared with userspace.

 * The NETMAP_RING is the userspace-visible replica of the NIC ring.
 * Each slot has the index of a buffer, its length and some flags.
 * In user space, the buffer address is computed as
 *	(char *)ring + buf_ofs + index*NETMAP_BUF_SIZE
 * In the kernel, buffers do not necessarily need to be contiguous,
 * and the virtual and physical addresses are derived through
 * a lookup table.
 * To associate a different buffer to a slot, applications must
 * write the new index in buf_idx, and set NS_BUF_CHANGED flag to
 * make sure that the kernel updates the hardware ring as needed.
 *
 * Normally the driver is not requested to report the result of
 * transmissions (this can dramatically speed up operation).
 * However the user may request to report completion by setting
 * NS_REPORT.

/*
 * Netmap representation of a TX or RX ring (also known as "queue").
 * This is a queue implemented as a fixed-size circular array.
 * At the software level, two fields are important: avail and cur.
 *
 * In TX rings:
 *	avail	indicates the number of slots available for transmission.
 *		It is updated by the kernel after every netmap system call.
 *		It MUST BE decremented by the application when it appends a
 *		packet.
 *	cur	indicates the slot to use for the next packet
 *		to send (i.e. the "tail" of the queue).
 *		It MUST BE incremented by the application before
 *		netmap system calls to reflect the number of newly
 *		sent packets.
 *		It is checked by the kernel on netmap system calls
 *		(normally unmodified by the kernel unless invalid).
 *
 *   The kernel side of netmap uses two additional fields in its own
 *   private ring structure, netmap_kring:
 *	nr_hwcur is a copy of nr_cur on an NIOCTXSYNC.
 *	nr_hwavail is the number of slots known as available by the
 *		hardware. It is updated on an INTR (inc by the
 *		number of packets sent) and on a NIOCTXSYNC
 *		(decrease by nr_cur - nr_hwcur)
 *		A special case, nr_hwavail is -1 if the transmit
 *		side is idle (no pending transmits).
 *
 * In RX rings:
 *	avail	is the number of packets available (possibly 0).
 *		It MUST BE decremented by the application when it consumes
 *		a packet, and it is updated to nr_hwavail on a NIOCRXSYNC
 *	cur	indicates the first slot that contains a packet not
 *		processed yet (the "head" of the queue).
 *		It MUST BE incremented by the software when it consumes
 *		a packet.
 *	reserved	indicates the number of buffers before 'cur'
 *		that the application has still in use. Normally 0,
 *		it MUST BE incremented by the application when it
 *		does not return the buffer immediately, and decremented
 *		when the buffer is finally freed.
 *
 *   The kernel side of netmap uses two additional fields in the kring:
 *	nr_hwcur is a copy of nr_cur on an NIOCRXSYNC
 *	nr_hwavail is the number of packets available. It is updated
 *		on INTR (inc by the number of new packets arrived)
 *		and on NIOCRXSYNC (decreased by nr_cur - nr_hwcur).
 *
 * DATA OWNERSHIP/LOCKING:
 *	The netmap_ring is owned by the user program and it is only
 *	accessed or modified in the upper half of the kernel during
 *	a system call.
 *
 *	The netmap_kring is only modified by the upper half of the kernel.
