/*
 * The netisr (network interrupt service routine) provides a deferred
 * execution evironment in which (generally inbound) network processing can
 * take place.  Protocols register handlers and, optionally, packet queues;
 * when packets are delivered to the queue, the protocol handler will be
 * executed directly, or via deferred dispatch depending on the
 * circumstances.
 *
 * Historically, this was implemented by the BSD software ISR facility; it is
 * now implemented via a software ithread (SWI).
