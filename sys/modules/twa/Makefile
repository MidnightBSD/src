# 3ware driver for 9000 series storage controllers.
#
# Author: Vinod Kashyap
#



#
# In the line following this comment, a value of 0 on the right hand
# side will not cause firmware to be bundled.  Change this value to 1
# to bundle the firmware with the driver, which may be flashed onto
# the controller, if the firmware on the controller is older than the
# one bundled, and needs to be upgraded.  The size of the driver will
# increase significantly (to over 500kB) if this option is selected.
# Typically, the firmware image bundled (in tw_cl_fwimg.c) corresponds
# to the latest controller architecture as of the date of the release.
# If the firmware for an earlier controller architecture needs to be
# flashed, the (older) driver with the appropriate firmware image
# bundled can be downloaded from the 3ware website, used to flash the
# firmware, and then the newer driver can be switched to.  Alternatively,
# the appropriate firmware image (tw_cl_fwimg.c) from the older driver can
# be used to re-build the newer driver.  In this case, the branch
# (TWA_CURRENT_FW_BRANCH_*) and build (TWA_CURRENT_FW_BUILD_*) numbers for
# the bundled firmware need to be appropriately updated in tw_cl_fwif.h
# before building the driver.
