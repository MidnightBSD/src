/*
 * Implementation of sleep queues used to hold queue of threads blocked on
 * a wait channel.  Sleep queues different from turnstiles in that wait
 * channels are not owned by anyone, so there is no priority propagation.
 * Sleep queues can also provide a timeout and can also be interrupted by
 * signals.  That said, there are several similarities between the turnstile
 * and sleep queue implementations.  (Note: turnstiles were implemented
 * first.)  For example, both use a hash table of the same size where each
 * bucket is referred to as a "chain" that contains both a spin lock and
 * a linked list of queues.  An individual queue is located by using a hash
 * to pick a chain, locking the chain, and then walking the chain searching
 * for the queue.  This means that a wait channel object does not need to
 * embed it's queue head just as locks do not embed their turnstile queue
 * head.  Threads also carry around a sleep queue that they lend to the
 * wait channel when blocking.  Just as in turnstiles, the queue includes
 * a free list of the sleep queues of other threads blocked on the same
 * wait channel in the case of multiple waiters.
 *
 * Some additional functionality provided by sleep queues include the
 * ability to set a timeout.  The timeout is managed using a per-thread
 * callout that resumes a thread if it is asleep.  A thread may also
 * catch signals while it is asleep (aka an interruptible sleep).  The
 * signal code uses sleepq_abort() to interrupt a sleeping thread.  Finally,
 * sleep queues also provide some extra assertions.  One is not allowed to
 * mix the sleep/wakeup and cv APIs for a given wait channel.  Also, one
 * must consistently use the same lock to synchronize with a wait channel,
 * though this check is currently only a warning for sleep/wakeup due to
 * pre-existing abuse of that API.  The same lock must also be held when
 * awakening threads, though that is currently only enforced for condition
 * variables.
