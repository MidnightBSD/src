/***
Here is the logic..

If there are N processors, then there are at most N KSEs (kernel
schedulable entities) working to process threads that belong to a
KSEGROUP (kg). If there are X of these KSEs actually running at the
moment in question, then there are at most M (N-X) of these KSEs on
the run queue, as running KSEs are not on the queue.

Runnable threads are queued off the KSEGROUP in priority order.
If there are M or more threads runnable, the top M threads
(by priority) are 'preassigned' to the M KSEs not running. The KSEs take
their priority from those threads and are put on the run queue.

The last thread that had a priority high enough to have a KSE associated
with it, AND IS ON THE RUN QUEUE is pointed to by
kg->kg_last_assigned. If no threads queued off the KSEGROUP have KSEs
assigned as all the available KSEs are activly running, or because there
are no threads queued, that pointer is NULL.

When a KSE is removed from the run queue to become runnable, we know
it was associated with the highest priority thread in the queue (at the head
of the queue). If it is also the last assigned we know M was 1 and must
now be 0. Since the thread is no longer queued that pointer must be
removed from it. Since we know there were no more KSEs available,
(M was 1 and is now 0) and since we are not FREEING our KSE
but using it, we know there are STILL no more KSEs available, we can prove
that the next thread in the ksegrp list will not have a KSE to assign to
it, so we can show that the pointer must be made 'invalid' (NULL).

The pointer exists so that when a new thread is made runnable, it can
have its priority compared with the last assigned thread to see if
it should 'steal' its KSE or not.. i.e. is it 'earlier'
on the list than that thread or later.. If it's earlier, then the KSE is
removed from the last assigned (which is now not assigned a KSE)
and reassigned to the new thread, which is placed earlier in the list.
The pointer is then backed up to the previous thread (which may or may not
be the new thread).

When a thread sleeps or is removed, the KSE becomes available and if there 
are queued threads that are not assigned KSEs, the highest priority one of
them is assigned the KSE, which is then placed back on the run queue at
the approipriate place, and the kg->kg_last_assigned pointer is adjusted down
to point to it.

The following diagram shows 2 KSEs and 3 threads from a single process.

 RUNQ: --->KSE---KSE--...    (KSEs queued at priorities from threads)
              \    \____   
               \        \
    KSEGROUP---thread--thread--thread    (queued in priority order)
        \                 / 
         \_______________/
          (last_assigned)

The result of this scheme is that the M available KSEs are always
queued at the priorities they have inherrited from the M highest priority
threads for that KSEGROUP. If this situation changes, the KSEs are 
reassigned to keep this true.
