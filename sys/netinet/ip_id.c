 * seed = random 15bit
 * n = prime, g0 = generator to n,
 * j = random so that gcd(j,n-1) == 1
 * g = g0^j mod n will be a generator again.
 *
 * X[0] = random seed.
 * X[n] = a*X[n-1]+b mod m is a Linear Congruential Generator
 * with a = 7^(even random) mod m,
 *      b = random with gcd(b,m) == 1
 *      m = 31104 and a maximal period of m-1.
 *
 * The transaction id is determined by:
 * id[n] = seed xor (g^X[n] mod n)
 *
 * Effectivly the id is restricted to the lower 15 bits, thus yielding two
 * different cycles by toggling the msb on and off.  This avoids reuse issues
 * caused by reseeding.
