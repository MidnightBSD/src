Readme for Octeon shared memory malloc

This malloc is based on ptmalloc2, which is the malloc
implementation of glibc.  Source code and more information
on this can be found at http://www.malloc.de/en/index.html.
Please see the individual files for licensing terms.

The main change to the code modifies the way the malloc
gets memory from the system.  Under Linux/Unix, malloc
uses the brk or memmap sytem calls to request more memory.
In this implementation, memory regions must be explicitly
given to malloc by the application.
