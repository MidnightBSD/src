/* Version information is made available at compile time in two forms:
** 1) a version string for printing
** 2) a combined SDK version and build number, suitable for comparisons
**    to determine what SDK version is being used.
**    SDK 1.2.3 build 567 => 102030567
**    Note that 2 digits are used for each version number, so that:
**     1.9.0  == 01.09.00 < 01.10.00 == 1.10.0 
**     10.9.0 == 10.09.00 > 09.10.00 == 9.10.0
