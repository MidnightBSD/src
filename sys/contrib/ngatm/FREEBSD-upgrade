$FreeBSD$

This is the part of the NgATM stuff that is shared by kernel and user.
Be careful to feed changes back to the maintainer <harti@freebsd.org>,
because the code here is actually shared with other environments besides
FreeBSD.

Import should be done by:

	1. Put the distribution into a clean directory.

	2. Remove any unneeded files.

	3. cvs import \
		-m "Virgin import of NgATM shared kernel/user part X.Y" \
		src/sys/contrib/ngatm/netnatm BEGEMOT NGATM_X_Y

	4. resolve conflicts

	5. check-out the imported stuff

	6. Re-generate files by calling ./genfiles

	7. If neccessary commit the re-generated files
