/*
 * Following is where TCP initial sequence number generation occurs.
 *
 * There are two places where we must use initial sequence numbers:
 * 1.  In SYN-ACK packets.
 * 2.  In SYN packets.
 *
 * All ISNs for SYN-ACK packets are generated by the syncache.  See
 * tcp_syncache.c for details.
 *
 * The ISNs in SYN packets must be monotonic; TIME_WAIT recycling
 * depends on this property.  In addition, these ISNs should be
 * unguessable so as to prevent connection hijacking.  To satisfy
 * the requirements of this situation, the algorithm outlined in
 * RFC 1948 is used, with only small modifications.
 *
 * Implementation details:
 *
 * Time is based off the system timer, and is corrected so that it
 * increases by one megabyte per second.  This allows for proper
 * recycling on high speed LANs while still leaving over an hour
 * before rollover.
 *
 * As reading the *exact* system time is too expensive to be done
 * whenever setting up a TCP connection, we increment the time
 * offset in two ways.  First, a small random positive increment
 * is added to isn_offset for each connection that is set up.
 * Second, the function tcp_isn_tick fires once per clock tick
 * and increments isn_offset as necessary so that sequence numbers
 * are incremented at approximately ISN_BYTES_PER_SECOND.  The
 * random positive increments serve only to ensure that the same
 * exact sequence number is never sent out twice (as could otherwise
 * happen when a port is recycled in less than the system tick
 * interval.)
 *
 * net.inet.tcp.isn_reseed_interval controls the number of seconds
 * between seeding of isn_secret.  This is normally set to zero,
 * as reseeding should not be necessary.
 *
 * Locking of the global variables isn_secret, isn_last_reseed, isn_offset,
 * isn_offset_old, and isn_ctx is performed using the TCP pcbinfo lock.  In
 * general, this means holding an exclusive (write) lock.
