The bwi firmware is not available for distribution
with MidnightBSD.  You must find it on the Internet.

Look for v3 firmware.  v4 will not work. Any device
requiring the newer firmware is not supported.

One might find files like:

a0g0bsinitvals2.fw      b0g0bsinitvals2.fw      ucode11.fw
a0g0bsinitvals5.fw      b0g0bsinitvals5.fw      ucode2.fw
a0g0initvals2.fw        b0g0initvals2.fw        ucode4.fw
a0g0initvals5.fw        b0g0initvals5.fw        ucode5.fw
a0g1bsinitvals5.fw      pcm4.fw
a0g1initvals5.fw        pcm5.fw
