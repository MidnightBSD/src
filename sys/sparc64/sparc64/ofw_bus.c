 * Map an interrupt using the firmware reg, interrupt-map and
 * interrupt-map-mask properties.
 * The interrupt property to be mapped must be of size intrsz, and pointed to
 * by intr. The regs property of the node for which the mapping is done must
 * be passed as regs. This property is an array of register specifications;
 * the size of the address part of such a specification must be passed as
 * physsz. Only the first element of the property is used.
 * imap and imapsz hold the interrupt mask and it's size.
 * imapmsk is a pointer to the interrupt-map-mask property, which must have
 * a size of physsz + intrsz; it may be NULL, in which case a full mask is
 * assumed.
 * maskbuf must point to a buffer of length physsz + intrsz.
 * The interrupt is returned in result, which must point to a buffer of length
 * rintrsz (which gives the expected size of the mapped interrupt).
 * Returns 1 if a mapping was found, 0 otherwise.
