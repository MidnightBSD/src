 * Per-IOMMU state. The parenthesized comments indicate the locking strategy:

 *	r - read-only after initialization.
 *	* - comment refers to pointer target / target hardware registers
 *	    (for bus_addr_t).
 * iommu_map_lruq is also locked by iommu_mtx. Elements of iommu_tsb may only
 * be accessed from functions operating on the map owning the corresponding
 * resource, so the locking the user is required to do to protect the map is
 * sufficient. As soon as the TSBs are divorced, these will be moved into struct
 * iommu_state, and each state struct will get its own lock.
 * iommu_dvma_rman needs to be moved there too, but has its own internal lock.
