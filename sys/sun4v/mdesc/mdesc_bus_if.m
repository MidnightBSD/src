# Interface for retrieving the package handle and a subset, namely
# 'compatible', 'device_type', 'model' and 'name', of the standard
# properties of a device on an Open Firmware assisted bus for use
# in device drivers. The rest of the standard properties, 'address',
# 'interrupts', 'reg' and 'status', are not covered by this interface
# as they are expected to be only of interest in the respective bus
# driver.
