Overview
========

This file describes the FreeBSD* driver, version 1.0.x, for the Intel(R)
PRO/10GbE Family of Adapters.  This driver has been developed for use with
FreeBSD, version 4.8 and later.

For questions related to hardware requirements, refer to the documentation
supplied with your Intel PRO/10GbE adapter.  All hardware requirements listed
apply to use with FreeBSD.



Supported Adapters
==================

The following Intel network adapters are compatible with the drivers in this 
release:

 Controller     Adapter Name                     Physical Layer
 ----------     ------------                     --------------

 82597EX        PRO/10GbE LR/SR Server Adapter   10G Base -LR and -SR
                                                 850 and 1310 nm optical fiber


Building and Installation
=========================

NOTE: You must have kernel sources installed in order to compile the driver
      module.

      In the instructions below, x.x.x is the driver version as indicated in
      the name of the driver tar.


1. Move the base driver tar file to the directory of your choice. For 
   example, use /home/username/ixgb or /usr/local/src/ixgb.

2. Untar/unzip the archive:
     tar xfz ixgb-x.x.x.tar.gz

3. To install man page:
     cd ixgb-x.x.x
     gzip -c ixgb.4 > /usr/share/man/man4/ixgb.4.gz

4. To load the driver onto a running system:
     cd ixgb-x.x.x/src
     make load

5. To assign an IP address to the interface, enter the following:
     ifconfig ixgb<interface_num> <IP_address>

6. Verify that the interface works. Enter the following, where <IP_address>
   is the IP address for another machine on the same subnet as the interface
   that is being tested:
     ping <IP_address>

7. If you want the driver to load automatically when the system is booted:

     cd ixgb-x.x.x/src
     make load
     cp if_ixgb.ko /modules
        
    Edit /boot/loader.conf, and add the following line:
     if_ixgb_load="YES"

     OR

     compile the driver into the kernel (see item 7).


   Edit /etc/rc.conf, and create the appropriate ifconfig_ixgb<interface_num> 
   entry:

     ifconfig_ixgb<interface_num>="<ifconfig_settings>"

     Example usage:

     ifconfig_ixgb0="inet 192.168.10.1 netmask 255.255.255.0"

     NOTE: For assistance, see the ifconfig man page.

8. If you want to compile the driver into the kernel, enter:

     cd ixgb-x.x.x/src

     mkdir /usr/src/sys/dev/ixgb

     cp if_ixgb* /usr/src/sys/dev/ixgb

     cp ixgb* /usr/src/sys/dev/ixgb  
 
     cp Makefile.kernel /usr/src/sys/modules/ixgb/Makefile

   If you have an i386 platform, you will need to edit the files.i386 file. 
   This is usually in /usr/src/sys/conf/; actual locations wil vary depending 
   on platform.  Add the following lines:

     dev/ixgb/ixgb_hw.c optional ixgb
     dev/ixgb/ixgb_ee.c optional ixgb
     dev/ixgb/if_ixgb.c optional ixgb


   Remove the following lines from the files.i386 file, if they exist:

     /dev/ixgb/if_ixgb_fx_hw.c optional ixgb
     /dev/ixgb/if_ixgb_phy.c optional ixgb

   Edit the kernel configuration file (i.e., GENERIC or MYKERNEL) in
   /usr/src/sys/i386/conf, and ensure the following line is present:

     device ixgb

   Compile and install the kernel.  The system must be reboot for the kernel 
   updates to take affect.  For additional information on compiling the kernel, 
   consult the FreeBSD operating system documentation.



Additional Configurations
=========================

The driver supports Transmit/Receive Checksum Offload and Jumbo Frames on
all PRO/10GbE adapters. 

  Jumbo Frames
  ------------
  To enable Jumbo Frames, use the ifconfig utility to increase the MTU
  beyond 1500 bytes.

  NOTES:
       - Only enable Jumbo Frames if your network infrastructure supports
         them.

       - The Jumbo Frames setting on the switch must be set to at least
         22 bytes larger than that of the adapter.

       - There are known performance issues with this driver when running 
         UDP traffic with Jumbo Frames. 

  The Jumbo Frames MTU range for Intel Adapters is 1500 to 16114. The default
  MTU range is 1500. To modify the setting, enter the following:

        ifconfig ixgb<interface_num> <hostname or IP address> mtu 9000

  To confirm an interface's MTU value, use the ifconfig command. To confirm
  the MTU used between two specific devices, use:

        route get <destination_IP_address>

 VLANs
  -----
  To create a new VLAN pseudo-interface:

        ifconfig <vlan_name> create

  To associate the VLAN pseudo-interface with a physical interface and
  assign a VLAN ID, IP address, and netmask:

        ifconfig <vlan_name> <ip_address> netmask <subnet_mask> vlan
           <vlan_id> vlandev <physical_interface>

  Example:

        ifconfig vlan10 10.0.0.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 vlan10 vlandev ixgb0

  In this example, all packets will be marked on egress with 802.1Q VLAN 
  tags, specifying a VLAN ID of 10.

  To remove a VLAN pseudo-interface:

        ifconfig <vlan_name> destroy

  Polling
  -------
  To enable polling in the driver, add the following options to the kernel
  configuration, and then recompile the kernel:

        options DEVICE_POLLING
        options HZ=1000

  At runtime, use the following command to turn on polling mode.

	ifconfig ixgb0 polling

  Similarly, turn off polling mode by removing IFCAP_POLLING flag from
  interface:

        ifconfig ixgb0 -polling

  The driver has to be built into the kernel for DEVICE POLLING to be
  enabled in the driver.
