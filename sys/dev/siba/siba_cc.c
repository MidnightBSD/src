/*
 * Child driver for ChipCommon core.
 * This is not MI code at the moment.
 * Two 16C550 compatible UARTs live here. On the WGT634U, uart1 is the
 * system console, and uart0 is not pinned out.
 *  Because their presence is conditional, they should probably
 *  be attached from here.
 * GPIO lives here.
 * The hardware watchdog lives here.
 * Clock control registers live here.
 *  You don't need to read them to determine the clock speed on the 5365,
 *  which is always 200MHz and thus may be hardcoded (for now).
 * Flash config registers live here. There may or may not be system flash.
 * The external interface bus lives here (conditionally).
 * There is a JTAG interface here which may be used to attach probes to
 * the SoC for debugging.
