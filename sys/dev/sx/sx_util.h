 *	delaying ten microseconds between each check.  We time out after

/*
 * sx_cd1865_etcmode()
 *	Set or clear embedded transmit command mode on a CD1865 port.
 *
 * Description:
 *	We can use commands embedded in the transmit data stream to do
 *	things like start and stop breaks or insert time delays.  We normally
 *	run with embedded commands disabled; this routine selects the channel
 *	we're dealing with and enables or disables embedded commands depending
 *	on the flag passed to it.  The caller must remember this state and
 *	escape any NULs it sends while embedded commands are enabled.
 *	Should be called at spltty().  Disables interrupts for the duration
 *	of the routine.
