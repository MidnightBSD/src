/*
 * Suggested Software Target Mode Command Handling structure.
 *
 * A note about terminology:
 *
 *   MD stands for "Machine Dependent".
 *
 *    This driver is structured in three layers: Outer MD, core, and inner MD.
 *    The latter also is bus dependent (i.e., is cognizant of PCI bus issues
 *    as well as platform issues).
 *
 *
 *   "Outer Layer" means "Other Module"
 *
 *    Some additional module that actually implements SCSI target command
 *    policy is the recipient of incoming commands and the source of the
 *    disposition for them.
 *
 * The command structure below is one suggested possible MD command structure,
 * but since the handling of thbis is entirely in the MD layer, there is
 * no explicit or implicit requirement that it be used.
 *
 * The cd_private tag should be used by the MD layer to keep a free list
 * of these structures. Code outside of this driver can then use this
 * to identify it's own unit structures. That is, when not on the MD
 * layer's freelist, the MD layer should shove into it the identifier
 * that the outer layer has for it- passed in on an initial QIN_HBA_REG
 * call (see below).
 *
 * The cd_hba tag is a tag that uniquely identifies the HBA this target
 * mode command is coming from. The outer layer has to pass this back
 * unchanged to avoid chaos.
 *
 * The cd_iid, cd_tgt, cd_lun and cd_port tags are used to identify the
 * id of the initiator who sent us a command, the target claim to be, the
 * lun on the target we claim to be, and the port instance (for multiple
 * port host adapters) that this applies to (consider it an extra port
 * parameter). The iid, tgt and lun values are deliberately chosen to be
 * fat so that, for example, World Wide Names can be used instead of
 * the units that the firmware uses (in the case where the MD
 * layer maintains a port database, for example).
 *
 * The cd_tagtype field specifies what kind of command tag type, if
 * any, has been sent with the command. Note that the Outer Layer
 * still needs to pass the tag handle through unchanged even
 * if the tag type is CD_UNTAGGED.
 *
 * The cd_cdb contains storage for the passed in command descriptor block.
 * There is no need to define length as the callee should be able to
 * figure this out.
 *
 * The tag cd_lflags are the flags set by the MD driver when it gets
 * command incoming or when it needs to inform any outside entities
 * that the last requested action failed.
 *
 * The tag cd_hflags should be set by any outside software to indicate
 * the validity of sense and status fields (defined below) and to indicate
 * the direction data is expected to move. It is an error to have both
 * CDFH_DATA_IN and CDFH_DATA_OUT set.
 *
 * If the CDFH_STSVALID flag is set, the command should be completed (after
 * sending any data and/or status). If CDFH_SNSVALID is set and the MD layer
 * can also handle sending the associated sense data (either back with an
 * FCP RESPONSE IU for Fibre Channel or otherwise automatically handling a
 * REQUEST SENSE from the initator for this target/lun), the MD layer will
 * set the CDFL_SENTSENSE flag on successful transmission of the sense data.
 * It is an error for the CDFH_SNSVALID bit to be set and CDFH_STSVALID not
 * to be set. It is an error for the CDFH_SNSVALID be set and the associated
 * SCSI status (cd_scsi_status) not be set to CHECK CONDITON.
 * 
 * The tag cd_data points to a data segment to either be filled or
 * read from depending on the direction of data movement. The tag
 * is undefined if no data direction is set. The MD layer and outer
 * layers must agree on the meaning of cd_data and it is specifically
 * not defined here.
 *
 * The tag cd_totlen is the total data amount expected to be moved
 * over the life of the command. It may be set by the MD layer, possibly
 * from the datalen field of an FCP CMND IU unit. If it shows up in the outer
 * layers set to zero and the CDB indicates data should be moved, the outer
 * layer should set it to the amount expected to be moved.
 *
 * The tag cd_resid should be the total residual of data not transferred.
 * The outer layers need to set this at the begining of command processing
 * to equal cd_totlen. As data is successfully moved, this value is decreased.
 * At the end of a command, any nonzero residual indicates the number of bytes
 * requested by the command but not moved.
 *
 * The tag cd_xfrlen is the length of the currently active data transfer.
 * This allows several interations between any outside software and the
 * MD layer to move data.
 *
 * The reason that total length and total residual have to be tracked
 * is to keep track of relative offset.
 *
 * The tags cd_sense and cd_scsi_status are pretty obvious.
 *
 * The tag cd_error is to communicate between the MD layer and outer software
 * the current error conditions.
 *
 * The tag cd_lreserved, cd_hreserved are scratch areas for use for the MD
 * and outer layers respectively.

/*
 * A word about the START/CONT/DONE/FIN dance:
 *
 *    When the HBA is enabled for receiving commands, one may show up
 *    without notice. When that happens, the MD target mode driver
 *    gets a tmd_cmd_t, fills it with the info that just arrived, and
 *    calls the outer layer with a QOUT_TMD_START code and pointer to
 *    the tmd_cmd_t.
 *
 *    The outer layer decodes the command, fetches data, prepares stuff,
 *    whatever, and starts by passing back the pointer with a QIN_TMD_CONT
 *    code which causes the MD target mode driver to generate CTIOs to
 *    satisfy whatever action needs to be taken. When those CTIOs complete,
 *    the MD target driver sends the pointer to the cmd_tmd_t back with
 *    a QOUT_TMD_DONE code. This repeats for as long as necessary. These
 *    may not be done in parallel- they are sequential operations.
 *
 *    The outer layer signals it wants to end the command by settings within
 *    the tmd_cmd_t itself. When the final QIN_TMD_CONT is reported completed,
 *    the outer layer frees the tmd_cmd_t by sending the pointer to it
 *    back with a QIN_TMD_FIN code.
 *
 *    The graph looks like:

 *    QOUT_TMD_START -> [ QIN_TMD_CONT -> QOUT_TMD_DONE ] * -> QIN_TMD_FIN.
