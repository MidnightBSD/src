 * Loadable firmware support.
 *
 * Firmware images are embedded in kernel loadable modules that can
 * be loaded on-demand or pre-loaded as desired.  Modules may contain
 * one or more firmware images that are stored as opaque data arrays
 * and registered with a unique string name.  Consumers request
 * firmware by name with held references counted to use in disallowing
 * module/data unload.
 *
 * When multiple images are stored in one module the one image is
 * treated as the master with the other images holding references
 * to it.  This means that to unload the module each dependent/subimage
 * must first have its references removed.
