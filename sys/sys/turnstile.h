/*
 * Turnstile interface.  Non-sleepable locks use a turnstile for the
 * queue of threads blocked on them when they are contested.
 *
 * A thread calls turnstile_lock() to lock the turnstile chain associated
 * with a given lock.  A thread calls turnstile_wait() when the lock is
 * contested to be put on the queue and block.  If a thread needs to retry
 * a lock operation instead of blocking, it should call turnstile_release()
 * to unlock the associated turnstile chain lock.
 *
 * When a lock is released, the thread calls turnstile_lookup() to loop
 * up the turnstile associated with the given lock in the hash table.  Then
 * it calls either turnstile_signal() or turnstile_broadcast() to mark
 * blocked threads for a pending wakeup.  turnstile_signal() marks the
 * highest priority blocked thread while turnstile_broadcast() marks all
 * blocked threads.  The turnstile_signal() function returns true if the
 * turnstile became empty as a result.  After the higher level code finishes
 * releasing the lock, turnstile_unpend() must be called to wake up the
 * pending thread(s).
 *
 * When a lock is acquired that already has at least one thread contested
 * on it, the new owner of the lock must claim ownership of the turnstile
 * via turnstile_claim().
 *
 * Each thread allocates a turnstile at thread creation via turnstile_alloc()
 * and releases it at thread destruction via turnstile_free().  Note that
 * a turnstile is not tied to a specific thread and that the turnstile
 * released at thread destruction may not be the same turnstile that the
 * thread allocated when it was created.
 *
 * A function can query a turnstile to see if it is empty via
 * turnstile_empty().  The highest priority thread blocked on a turnstile
 * can be obtained via turnstile_head().
