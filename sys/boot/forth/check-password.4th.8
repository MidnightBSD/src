.Sh NAME
.Nm check-password.4th
.Nd FreeBSD password-checking boot module
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The file that goes by the name of
.Nm
is a set of commands designed to either prevent booting or prevent modification
of boot options without an appropriately configured password.
The commands of
.Nm
by themselves are not enough for most uses.
Please refer to the
examples below for the most common situations, and to
.Xr loader 8
for additional commands.
.Pp
Before using any of the commands provided in
.Nm ,
it must be included
through the command:
.Pp
.Dl include check-password.4th
.Pp
This line is present in
.Pa /boot/loader.4th
file, so it is not needed (and should not be re-issued) in a normal setup.
.Pp
The commands provided by it are:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width disable-module_module -compact -offset indent
.It Ic check-password
Dual-purpose function that can either protect the interactive boot menu or
prevent boot without password (separately).
.Pp
First checks
.Va bootlock_password
and if-set, the user cannot continue until the correct password is entered.
.Pp
Next checks
.Va password
and if-set, tries to
.Ic autoboot
and only prompts for password on failure or user-interrupt.
See
.Xr loader.conf 5
for additional information.
.El
.Pp
The environment variables that effect its behavior are:
.Bl -tag -width bootlock_password -offset indent
.It Va bootlock_password
Sets the bootlock password (up to 16 characters long) that is required by
.Ic check-password
to be entered before the system is allowed to boot.
.It Va password
Sets the password (up to 16 characters long) that is required by
.Ic check-password
before the user is allowed to visit the boot menu.
