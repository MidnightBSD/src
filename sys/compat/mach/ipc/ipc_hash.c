/*
 *	Each space has a local reverse hash table, which holds
 *	entries from the space's table.  In fact, the hash table
 *	just uses a field (ie_index) in the table itself.
 *
 *	The local hash table is an open-addressing hash table,
 *	which means that when a collision occurs, instead of
 *	throwing the entry into a bucket, the entry is rehashed
 *	to another position in the table.  In this case the rehash
 *	is very simple: linear probing (ie, just increment the position).
 *	This simple rehash makes deletions tractable (they're still a pain),
 *	but it means that collisions tend to build up into clumps.
 *
 *	Because at least one entry in the table (index 0) is always unused,
 *	there will always be room in the reverse hash table.  If a table
 *	with n slots gets completely full, the reverse hash table will
 *	have one giant clump of n-1 slots and one free slot somewhere.
 *	Because entries are only entered into the reverse table if they
 *	are pure send rights (not receive, send-once, port-set,
 *	or dead-name rights), and free entries of course aren't entered,
 *	I expect the reverse hash table won't get unreasonably full.
 *
 *	Ordered hash tables (Amble & Knuth, Computer Journal, v. 17, no. 2,
 *	pp. 135-142.) may be desirable here.  They can dramatically help
 *	unsuccessful lookups.  But unsuccessful lookups are almost always
 *	followed by insertions, and those slow down somewhat.  They
 *	also can help deletions somewhat.  Successful lookups aren't affected.
 *	So possibly a small win; probably nothing significant.
