# SMP OPTIONS:
#
# The apic device enables the use of the I/O APIC for interrupt delivery.
# The apic device can be used in both UP and SMP kernels, but is required
# for SMP kernels.  Thus, the apic device is not strictly an SMP option,
# but it is a prerequisite for SMP.

# Mandatory:
device		apic			# I/O apic

# CPU OPTIONS

#
# You must specify at least one CPU (the one you intend to run on);
# deleting the specification for CPUs you don't need to use may make
# parts of the system run faster.
#
cpu		I486_CPU
cpu		I586_CPU		# aka Pentium(tm)
cpu		I686_CPU		# aka Pentium Pro(tm)

#
# Options for CPU features.
#
# CPU_BLUELIGHTNING_3X enables triple-clock mode on IBM Blue Lightning
# CPU if CPU supports it.  The default is double-clock mode on
# BlueLightning CPU box.
#
# CPU_BLUELIGHTNING_FPU_OP_CACHE enables FPU operand cache on IBM
# BlueLightning CPU.  It works only with Cyrix FPU, and this option
# should not be used with Intel FPU.
#
# CPU_BTB_EN enables branch target buffer on Cyrix 5x86 (NOTE 1).
#
# CPU_CYRIX_NO_LOCK enables weak locking for the entire address space
# of Cyrix 6x86 and 6x86MX CPUs by setting the NO_LOCK bit of CCR1.
# Otherwise, the NO_LOCK bit of CCR1 is cleared.  (NOTE 3)
#
# CPU_DIRECT_MAPPED_CACHE sets L1 cache of Cyrix 486DLC CPU in direct
# mapped mode.  Default is 2-way set associative mode.
#
# CPU_DISABLE_5X86_LSSER disables load store serialize (i.e., enables
# reorder).  This option should not be used if you use memory mapped
# I/O device(s).
#
# CPU_DISABLE_CMPXCHG disables the CMPXCHG instruction on > i386 IA32
# machines.  VmWare 3.x seems to emulate this instruction poorly, causing
# the guest OS to run very slowly.  This problem appears to be fixed in
# VmWare 4.x, at least in version 4.5.2, so that enabling this option with
# VmWare 4.x will result in locking operations to be 20-30 times slower.
# Enabling this with an SMP kernel will cause the kernel to be unusable.
#
# CPU_DISABLE_SSE explicitly prevents I686_CPU from turning on SSE.
#
# CPU_FASTER_5X86_FPU enables faster FPU exception handler.
#
# CPU_I486_ON_386 enables CPU cache on i486 based CPU upgrade products
# for i386 machines.
#
# CPU_IORT defines I/O clock delay time (NOTE 1).  Default values of
# I/O clock delay time on Cyrix 5x86 and 6x86 are 0 and 7,respectively
# (no clock delay).
#
# CPU_L2_LATENCY specifies the L2 cache latency value.  This option is used
# only when CPU_PPRO2CELERON is defined and Mendocino Celeron is detected.
# The default value is 5.
#
# CPU_LOOP_EN prevents flushing the prefetch buffer if the destination
# of a jump is already present in the prefetch buffer on Cyrix 5x86(NOTE
# 1).
#
# CPU_PPRO2CELERON enables L2 cache of Mendocino Celeron CPUs.  This option
# is useful when you use Socket 8 to Socket 370 converter, because most Pentium
# Pro BIOSs do not enable L2 cache of Mendocino Celeron CPUs.
#
# CPU_RSTK_EN enables return stack on Cyrix 5x86 (NOTE 1).
#
# CPU_SUSP_HLT enables suspend on HALT.  If this option is set, CPU
# enters suspend mode following execution of HALT instruction.
#
# CPU_UPGRADE_HW_CACHE eliminates unneeded cache flush instruction(s).
#
# CPU_WT_ALLOC enables write allocation on Cyrix 6x86/6x86MX and AMD
# K5/K6/K6-2 CPUs.
#
# CYRIX_CACHE_WORKS enables CPU cache on Cyrix 486 CPUs with cache
# flush at hold state.
#
# CYRIX_CACHE_REALLY_WORKS enables (1) CPU cache on Cyrix 486 CPUs
# without cache flush at hold state, and (2) write-back CPU cache on
# Cyrix 6x86 whose revision < 2.7 (NOTE 2).
#
# NO_F00F_HACK disables the hack that prevents Pentiums (and ONLY
# Pentiums) from locking up when a LOCK CMPXCHG8B instruction is
# executed.  This option is only needed if I586_CPU is also defined,
# and should be included for any non-Pentium CPU that defines it.
#
# NO_MEMORY_HOLE is an optimisation for systems with AMD K6 processors
# which indicates that the 15-16MB range is *definitely* not being
# occupied by an ISA memory hole.
#
# NOTE 1: The options, CPU_BTB_EN, CPU_LOOP_EN, CPU_IORT,
# CPU_LOOP_EN and CPU_RSTK_EN should not be used because of CPU bugs.
# These options may crash your system.
#
# NOTE 2: If CYRIX_CACHE_REALLY_WORKS is not set, CPU cache is enabled
# in write-through mode when revision < 2.7.  If revision of Cyrix
# 6x86 >= 2.7, CPU cache is always enabled in write-back mode.
#
# NOTE 3: This option may cause failures for software that requires
# locked cycles in order to operate correctly.

#####################################################################
# NETWORKING OPTIONS

#
# DEVICE_POLLING adds support for mixed interrupt-polling handling
# of network device drivers, which has significant benefits in terms
# of robustness to overloads and responsivity, as well as permitting
# accurate scheduling of the CPU time between kernel network processing
# and other activities.  The drawback is a moderate (up to 1/HZ seconds)
# potential increase in response times.
# It is strongly recommended to use HZ=1000 or 2000 with DEVICE_POLLING
# to achieve smoother behaviour.
# Additionally, you can enable/disable polling at runtime with help of
# the ifconfig(8) utility, and select the CPU fraction reserved to
# userland with the sysctl variable kern.polling.user_frac
# (default 50, range 0..100).
#
# Not all device drivers support this mode of operation at the time of
# this writing.  See polling(4) for more details.

# BPF_JITTER adds support for BPF just-in-time compiler.

# MISCELLANEOUS DEVICES AND OPTIONS

# 
# sio: serial ports (see sio(4)), including support for various
#      PC Card devices, such as Modem and NICs
#
#device		sio
hint.sio.0.at="isa"
hint.sio.0.port="0x3F8"
hint.sio.0.flags="0x10"
hint.sio.0.irq="4"

# `flags' specific to sio(4).
#	0x10	enable console support for this unit.  Other console flags
#		(if applicable) are ignored unless this is set.  Enabling
#		console support does not make the unit the preferred console.
#		Boot with -h or set boot_serial=YES in the loader.  For sio(4)
#		specifically, the 0x20 flag can also be set (see above).
#		Currently, at most one unit can have console support; the
#		first one (in config file order) with this flag set is
#		preferred.  Setting this flag for sio0 gives the old behaviour.
#	0x20	force this unit to be the console (unless there is another
#		higher priority console).  This replaces the COMCONSOLE option.
#	0x40	reserve this unit for low level console operations.  Do not
#		access the device in any normal way.
#	0x80	use this port for serial line gdb support in ddb.  Also known
#		as debug port.
# PnP `flags'
#	0x1	disable probing of this device.  Used to prevent your modem
#		from being attached as a PnP modem.
# Other flags for sio that aren't documented in the man page.
#	0x20000	enable hardware RTS/CTS and larger FIFOs.  Only works for
#		ST16650A-compatible UARTs.

# Options for sio:
options 	COM_ESP			# Code for Hayes ESP.
options 	COM_MULTIPORT		# Code for some cards with shared IRQs.
options 	CONSPEED=115200		# Speed for serial console
					# (default 9600).

# HARDWARE BUS CONFIGURATION

#
# ISA bus
#
device		isa

#
# Options for `isa':
#
# AUTO_EOI_1 enables the `automatic EOI' feature for the master 8259A
# interrupt controller.  This saves about 0.7-1.25 usec for each interrupt.
# This option breaks suspend/resume on some portables.
#
# MAXMEM specifies the amount of RAM on the machine; if this is not
# specified, FreeBSD will first read the amount of memory from the CMOS
# RAM, so the amount of memory will initially be limited to 64MB or 16MB
# depending on the BIOS.  If the BIOS reports 64MB, a memory probe will
# then attempt to detect the installed amount of RAM.  If this probe
# fails to detect >64MB RAM you will have to use the MAXMEM option.
# The amount is in kilobytes, so for a machine with 128MB of RAM, it would
# be 131072 (128 * 1024).
#
# BROKEN_KEYBOARD_RESET disables the use of the keyboard controller to
# reset the CPU for reboot.  This is needed on some systems with broken
# keyboard controllers.
#
# EPSON_BOUNCEDMA was to use a bounce buffer to upper 15MB, but it's
# broken now.
#
# EPSON_MEMWIN disables 15-16MB chunk, and enables EPSON memory window.

#	0x02	don't use the npx registers to optimize bzero.
#	0x04	don't use the npx registers to optimize copyin or copyout.
# The npx registers are normally used to optimize copying and zeroing when
# all of the following conditions are satisfied:
#	I586_CPU is an option
#	the cpu is an i586 (perhaps not a Pentium)
#	the probe for npx0 succeeds
#	INT 16 exception handling works.
# Then copying and zeroing using the npx registers is normally 30-100% faster.
# The flags can be used to control cases where it doesn't work or is slower.
# Setting them at boot time using hints works right (the optimizations
