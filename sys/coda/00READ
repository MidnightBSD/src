WARNING:
	A version of this code has run on stable for a while now.
	The code has been recently ported to current.  It is mostly
	working, but hasn't been run long enough to be sure all the
	bugs are sorted out.  Let me know if there are any problems.
	In particular, killing venus (or rebooting) when/if venus
	is hung, may not work correctly.

	This code is not SMP ready.  Most locks are on vnodes
	and cnodes and go thru the lock manager.  There are a
	few hashes and queues that need to be locked -- I think that's
	all that is needed.
