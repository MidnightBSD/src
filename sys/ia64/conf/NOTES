# directive: cpu
# You must specify at least one CPU (the one you intend to run on). Deleting
# the support for CPUs you don't need to use may make parts of the system run
# faster. There's currently no special code for the different CPUs. Note also
# that the cpu declares the family. We may need to add support for specifying
# particular models.
