# These files are imported from Ian Campbell's git tree mirroring the linux
# kernel.
#
# git clone git://xenbits.xen.org/people/ianc/device-tree-rebasing.git
#
# will grab the latest tree. It is imported into vendor/device-tree/dist and tagged
# with the svn cp command, per the handbook.
#
# We only import those files from here that we know work with some kernel, rather than
# all of them. This means we have an 'opt in' list rather than an 'opt out' list
# that's more typical for FreeBSD. The opt-in list should be relative to the top level
# directory (so a bunch of lines starting with src). We import src/$ARCH/foo into
# sys/gnu/dts/$ARCH/foo with the goal being to use as many of these files as possible
# unmodified for FreeBSD. This isn't always possible, but there are workarounds.
#
# This script should take care of all that the first time...
