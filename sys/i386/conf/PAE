include GENERIC

ident		PAE-GENERIC

# To make a PAE kernel, the next option is needed
options 	PAE			# Physical Address Extensions Kernel

# Don't build modules with this kernel config, since they are not built with
# the correct options headers.
makeoptions	NO_MODULES=yes

# force isp firmware to fully loaded
device		ispfw

# What follows is a list of drivers that are normally in GENERIC, but either
# don't work or are untested with PAE.  Be very careful before enabling any
# of these drivers.  Drivers which use DMA and don't handle 64 bit physical
# address properly may cause data corruption when used in a machine with more
# than 4 gigabytes of memory.
