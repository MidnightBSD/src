1) SMP/Locking

	The code makes use of ng_send_fn() whenever possible. Just
	need to verify and make sure i did it right

2) Review USB ATTACH function

	It is a bit ugly now. Probably need a better way to discover
	USB device configuration.

2) Firmware upgrade

	According to Bluetooth spec device may present third interface
	to perform firmware upgrade. 3Com USB Bluetooth dongle has
	such interface. Need to implement set of Netgraph messages.

3) Understand and fix isoc. USB transfers (SCO data)

	Currenty device reports that is got zero bytes and calls
	isoc_in_complete callback over and over again. Why?
	Also might need to setup at least two isoc. transfers in
	both directions and switch them on the fly. Just to ensure
	there at least one transfer at any time ready to run.

4) Currently interrupt transfers are done as bulk-in transfers

	Need to check if that is allowed.
