.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Ar command
.Op Fl options
.Sh COMMANDS
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ic checkparity Oo Fl f Oc Ar plex
Check the parity blocks of a RAID-5 plex.
The parity check will start at the
beginning of the plex if the
.Fl f
flag is specified, or otherwise at the location of the parity check pointer,
the first location at which plex's parity is incorrect.
All subdisks in the
plex must be up for a parity check.
.It Ic create Op Ar description-file
Create a volume as described in
.Ar description-file .
If no
.Ar description-file
provided, opens an editor and provides the current
.Nm
configuration for editing.
.It Ic help
Provides a synopsis of
.Nm
commands and arguments.
.It Ic l | list Oo Fl rvV Oc Op Ar volume | plex | subdisk
.It Ic ld Oo Fl rvV Oc Op Ar drive ...
.It Ic ls Oo Fl rvV Oc Op Ar subdisk ...
.It Ic lp Oo Fl rvV Oc Op Ar plex ...
.It Ic lv Oo Fl rvV Oc Op Ar volume ...
List information about the relevant object(s).
The
.Fl r
flag provides recursive display, showing each object's subordinate objects in
proper relation.
The
.Fl v
and
.Fl V
flags provide progressively more detailed output.
.It Ic move | mv Fl f Ar drive subdisk Op Ar ...
Move the subdisk(s) to the specified drive.
The
.Fl f
flag is required, as all data on the indicated subdisk(s) will be destroyed as
part of the move.
This can currently only be done when the subdisk is
not being accessed.
.Pp
If the subdisk(s) form part of a RAID-5 plex, the disk(s) will need to be set
to the
.Dq up
state and the plex will require a
.Ic rebuildparity
command; if the subdisk(s) form part of a plex that is mirrored with other
plexes, the plex will require restarting and will sync once restarted.
Moving
more than one subdisk in a RAID-5 plex or subdisks from both sides of a
mirrored plex volume will destroy data.
Note that parity rebuilds and syncing
must be started manually after a move.
.It Ic printconfig
Write a copy of the current configuration to standard output.
.It Ic quit
Exit
.Nm
when running in interactive mode.
Normally this would be done by entering the
EOF character.
.It Ic rename Oo Fl r Oc Ar drive | subdisk | plex | volume newname
Change the name of the specified object.
The
.Fl r
flag will recursively rename subordinate objects.
.Pp
Note that device nodes will not be renamed until
.Nm
is restarted.
.It Ic rebuildparity Oo Fl f Oc Ar plex
Rebuild the parity blocks of a RAID-5 plex.
The parity rebuild will start at
the beginning of the plex if the
.Fl f
flag is specified, or otherwise at the location of the parity check pointer.
All subdisks in the plex must be up for a parity check.
.It Ic resetconfig
Reset the complete
.Nm
configuration.
.It Ic rm Oo Fl r Oc Ar volume | plex | subdisk
Remove an object and, if
.Fl r
is specified, its subordinate objects.
.It Ic saveconfig
Save
.Nm
configuration to disk after configuration failures.
.It Ic setstate Oo Fl f Oc Ar state volume | plex | subdisk | drive
Set state without influencing other objects, for diagnostic purposes
only.
The
.Fl f
flag forces state changes regardless of whether they are legal.
.It Ic start
Read configuration from all vinum drives.
.It Ic start Oo Fl S Ar size Oc Ar volume | plex | subdisk
Allow the system to access the objects.
The
.Fl S
flag is currently ignored.
.El
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility communicates with the kernel component of the GVinum logical volume
manager.
It is designed either for interactive use, when started without
command line arguments, or to execute a single command if the command is
supplied on the command line.
In interactive mode,
.Nm
maintains a command line history.
.Sh OPTIONS
The
.Nm
commands may be followed by an option.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl f
The
.Fl f
.Pq Dq force
option overrides safety checks.
It should be used with extreme caution.
This
option is required in order to use the
.Ic move
command.
.It Fl r
The
.Fl r
.Pq Dq recursive
option applies the command recursively to subordinate objects.
For example, in
conjunction with the
.Ic lv
command, the
.Fl r
option will also show information about the plexes and subdisks belonging to
the volume.
It is also used by the
.Ic rename
command to indicate that subordinate objects such as subdisks should be renamed
to match the object(s) specified and by the
.Ic rm
command to delete plexes belonging to a volume and so on.
.It Fl v
The
.Fl v
.Pq Dq verbose
option provides more detailed output.
.It Fl V
The
.Fl V
.Pq Dq "very verbose"
option provides even more detailed output than
.Fl v .
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width ".Ev EDITOR"
.It Ev EDITOR
The name of the editor to use for editing configuration files, by
default
.Xr vi 1
is invoked.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width ".Pa /dev/gvinum/plex"
.It Pa /dev/gvinum
directory with device nodes for
.Nm
objects
.It Pa /dev/gvinum/plex
directory containing device nodes for
.Nm
plexes
.It Pa /dev/gvinum/sd

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility first appeared in
.Fx 5.3 .
The
.Nm vinum
utility, on which
.Nm
is based, was written by
.An "Greg Lehey" .
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility
was written by
.An "Lukas Ertl" .
The
.Ic move
and
.Ic rename
commands and
documentation were added by
.An "Chris Jones"
through the 2005 Google Summer
of Code program.

.Sh BUGS
Currently,
.Nm
does not rename devices in
.Pa /dev/gvinum
until reloaded.
.Pp
The
.Fl S
initsize flag to
.Ic start
is ignored.
.Pp
The
.Ic stop
command does not work.
.Pp
Moving subdisks that are not part of a mirrored or RAID-5 volume will
destroy data.
It is perhaps a bug to permit this.
.Pp
Plexes in which subdisks have been moved do not automatically sync or
rebuild parity.
This may leave data unprotected and is perhaps unwise.
.Pp
Currently,
.Nm
does not yet fully implement all of the functions found in
.Xr vinum 4 .
Specifically, the following commands from
.Xr vinum 4
are not supported:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ic attach Ar plex volume Op Cm rename
.It Ic attach Ar subdisk plex Oo Ar offset Oc Op Cm rename
Attach a plex to a volume, or a subdisk to a plex.
.It Ic concat Oo Fl fv Oc Oo Fl n Ar name Oc Ar drives
Create a concatenated volume from the specified drives.
.It Ic debug
Cause the volume manager to enter the kernel debugger.
.It Ic debug Ar flags
Set debugging flags.
.It Ic detach Oo Fl f Oc Op Ar plex | subdisk
Detach a plex or subdisk from the volume or plex to which it is
attached.
.It Ic dumpconfig Op Ar drive ...

List information about volume manager state.
.It Ic label Ar volume
