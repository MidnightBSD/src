.Dt REBOOT 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm reboot ,
.Nm halt ,
.Nm fastboot ,
.Nm fasthalt
.Nd stopping and restarting the system
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm halt
.Op Fl lnpq
.Op Fl k Ar kernel
.Nm
.Op Fl dlnpq
.Op Fl k Ar kernel
.Nm fasthalt
.Op Fl lnpq
.Op Fl k Ar kernel
.Nm fastboot
.Op Fl dlnpq
.Op Fl k Ar kernel
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm halt
and
.Nm
utilities flush the file system cache to disk, send all running processes
a
.Dv SIGTERM
(and subsequently a
.Dv SIGKILL )
and, respectively, halt or restart the system.
The action is logged, including entering a shutdown record into the user
accounting database.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl d
The system is requested to create a crash dump.
This option is
supported only when rebooting, and it has no effect unless a dump
device has previously been specified with
.Xr dumpon 8 .
.It Fl k Ar kernel
Boot the specified
.Ar kernel
on the next system boot.
If the kernel boots successfully, the
.Em default
kernel will be booted on successive boots, this is a one-shot option.
If the boot fails, the system will continue attempting to boot
.Ar kernel
until the boot process is interrupted and a valid kernel booted.
This may change in the future.
.It Fl l
The halt or reboot is
.Em not
logged to the system log.
This option is intended for applications such as
.Xr shutdown 8 ,
that call
.Nm
or
.Nm halt
and log this themselves.
.It Fl n
The file system cache is not flushed.
This option should probably not be used.
.It Fl p
The system will turn off the power if it can.
If the power down action fails, the system
will halt or reboot normally, depending on whether
.Nm halt
or
.Nm
was called.
.It Fl q
The system is halted or restarted quickly and ungracefully, and only
the flushing of the file system cache is performed (if the
.Fl n
option is not specified).
This option should probably not be used.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm fasthalt
and
.Nm fastboot
utilities are nothing more than aliases for the
.Nm halt
and
.Nm
utilities.
.Pp
Normally, the
.Xr shutdown 8
utility is used when the system needs to be halted or restarted, giving
users advance warning of their impending doom and cleanly terminating
specific programs.
