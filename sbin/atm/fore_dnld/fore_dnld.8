.Nd "download FORE Systems' microcode into host ATM adapter"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl 3
.Op Fl i Ar intf
.Op Fl d Ar path
.Op Fl f Ar objfile
.Op Fl r
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility downloads FORE Systems' microcode into the host ATM adapter(s).
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl i Ar intf
Specify which ATM interface to download microcode to.
Default is to load microcode into all FORE Systems host adapters.
.It Fl d Ar path
Specify the path to prepend to the
.Ar objfile
name.
Default is to use current directory.
.It Fl f Ar objfile
Specify the microcode binary file.
Defaults are:
.Pa sba200.obj
for SBA-200 adapters,
.Pa sba200e.obj
for SBA-200E adapters, and
.Pa pca200e.bin
for PCA-200E adapters.
.El
.Sh NOTES
For the PCA200E adapter, if no file is specified on the command
line a built-in copy of version 4.1.12 microcode is used.
When the
option
.Fl 3
is specified version 3.0.1 microcode is used instead.
.Pp
Microcode as distributed by FORE Systems is not ready for downloading
directly into SBA host ATM adapters.
Instead, the supplied microcode needs
to be processed with the
.Xr objcopy 1
command to create an image suitable
for downloading.
Arguments to
.Xr objcopy 1
are
.Dq Li "-S -l -Fcoff" .
.Pp
Microcode as
distributed by FORE Systems for the PCA host ATM adapter does not need
to be processed.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Pa ~fore/etc/objcopy
command to process FORE Systems supplied microcode.
.It Pa ~fore/etc/sba200*.ucode*
microcode as supplied by FORE Systems for SBA
adapters.
.It Pa ~fore/i386/pca200e.bin
microcode as supplied by FORE Systems for PCA
adapters.
.It Pa ~harp/doc/Install
HARP installation instructions.
