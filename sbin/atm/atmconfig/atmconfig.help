ATM configuration utility.
usage:
	atmconfig [common-options] command [subcommand] [options]

Use 'atmconfig help' for general help or 'atmconfig help <command>' for
help on 'command' or 'atmconfig help commands' for a list of commands.

^0 help
^^  help		show help information
Use one of the following commands to get help on atmconfig:

  atmconfig help options
	gives you help on common command line options
  atmconfig help commands
	prints a list of available commands (and help items)
  atmconfig help <command>
	prints help on the given command (including a list of subcommands)
  atmconfig help <command> <subcommand>
	gives help on the given subcommand

^0 options
^^  help options	list common options
Common command line options can be specified for all commands. They
are written immediately before the command. The following options are
available:

 -h		print short help
 -t		don't print headings for 'show'-type commands
 -v		be verbose about all actions.

^0 commands
^^  help commands	show available commands
The following commands are available:

$MAIN

^0 diag
^^  diag		show/modify ATM hardware interfaces
This command shows information about the ATM hardware interfaces in the
system. A list of ATM devices is obtained by:

  atmconfig [common-options] diag list

Information about the hardware configuration of the ATM interfaces is
reported by:

  atmconfig [common-options] diag config [options] [<device> ...]

The phy chip can be access with:

  atmconfig [common-options] diag phy print [options] <device>
  atmconfig [common-options] diag phy show <device>
  atmconfig [common-options] diag phy set <device> <reg> <msk> <val>
  atmconfig [common-options] diag phy set stats [options] <device>

A list of open VCCs can be obtained with:

  atmconfig [common-options] diag vcc [<device> ...]

Driver internal statistics are printed with

  atmconfig [common-options] diag stats <device>

^1 list
usage: atmconfig [common-options] diag list

List all known ATM devices in the system.

^1 config
usage: atmconfig [common-options] diag config [-hardware] [-atm] [device ...]
options:
  -hardware	print hardware related information
  -atm		print ATM related information

If now device is given as argument information about all devices is shown.
The default is to print only ATM related information.

^1 phy
To show the type of the PHY and its state:

  atmconfig [common-options] diag phy show <device>

Change a PHY register (use with care):

  atmconfig [common-options] diag phy set <device> <reg> <msk> <val>

Print the PHY registers in a human readable form:

  atmconfig [common-options] diag phy print [-numeric] <device>

The PHY statistics can be printed with:

  atmconfig [common-options] diag phy stats [-clear] <device>

^2 show
usage: atmconfig [common-options] diag phy show <device>

Show configuration and state information about the PHY chip on the given
ATM interface.

^2 set
usage: atmconfig [common-options] diag phy set <device> <reg> <msk> <val>

Set the bits of given PHY chip register for which the corresponding bit in
<msk> is one to the value of the corresponding bit in <val>. All register
bits that have a zero in <msk> are written back with there original value.

^2 print
usage: atmconfig [common-options] diag phy print [-numeric] <device>
options:
  -numeric	print registers in hex

Print the registers of the PHY chip in a human readable format.

^2 stats
usage: atmconfig [common-options] diag phy stats [-clear] <device>
options:
  -clear	clear the statistics atomically after reading them

Prints the PHY layer statistics of the PHY chip and optionally clears them.

^1 vcc
usage: atmconfig [common-options] diag vcc [-abr] [-channel] [-traffic]
		 [<device> ...]
options:
  -abr		print ABR specific traffic parameters
  -channel	print VPI, VCI, AAL, traffic type and flags (default)
  -traffic	print traffic parameters

Prints a list of all open vccs. The default output is -channel.

^1 stats
usage: atmconfig [common-options] diag stats <device>

Prints the driver-internal statistics.

^0 natm
^^  natm		simple IP over ATM management (see natmip(4))
The group of CLIP commands is used to manage classical IP over ATM
networking via NATM (see natm(4) and natmip(4)). A new PVC is added
to a CLIP via:

  atmconfig [common-options] natm add <dest> <device> <vpi> <vci>
    <encaps> [<traffic> [<params> ...]]

The PVC can be deleted with:

  atmconfig [common-options] natm del <device> <vpi> <vci>

The list of PVC that are currently active is retrieved with:

  atmconfig [common-options] natm show

^1 add
usage: atmconfig [common-options] natm add [-printonly] <dest> <device>
		 <vpi> <vci> <encaps> [<traffic> [<params> ...]]
options:
  -printonly	don't execute, print the route(8) command

This subcommand adds a new CLIP PVC on the ATM interface <device>. The
host on the other end of the PVC has IP address <addr>. <encaps> is one
of llc/snap (LLC/SNAP encapsulated frames in AAL5) or aal5 (AAL5 frames
without LLC/SNAP). <traffic> specifies the traffic type of the PVC
and is one of UBR, CBR, VBR or ABR. If not given UBR is assumed. Depending
on the traffic type none or more parameters can follow:

  ubr [<pcr>]
  cbr <pcr>
  vbr <pcr> <scr> <mbs>
  abr <pcr> <mcr> <icr> <tbe> <nrm> <trm> <adtf> <rif> <rdf> <cdf>

^1 delete
usage: atmconfig [common-options] natm delete [-printonly] <dest>
   or: atmconfig [common-options] natm delete [-printonly] <device> <vpi> <vci>
options:
  -printonly	don't execute, print the route(8) command

This subcommand deletes and existing CLIP PVC that can bei either identified
by the destination address or by the <device><vpi><vci> triple.

^1 show
usage: atmconfig [common-options] natm show [-abr] [-numeric]
options:
  -abr		show ABR parameters for ABR connections
  -numeric	print IP addresses numerically

This subcommand prints all ATM routes.
