.SH DESCRIPTION
.I atm
configures and displays the status of the Host ATM Research Platform
(HARP) networking software.
The subcommands fall into several categories:
.PP
\fIInterface management\fP subcommands allow manipulation of the
ATM interface.
Functions include assigning a signalling manager to an interface,
setting the ATM address, associating network interfaces with
an interface, and displaying information about interfaces.
.PP
\fIVCC management\fP subcommands allow for managing ATM virtual
channel connections (VCCs).
Functions include opening and closing VCCs and displaying information
about them.
.PP
\fIIP management\fP subcommands allow for managing the interface
between IP and the ATM software.
Functions include displaying and manipulating the ATMARP cache,
opening a PVC connected to IP,
assigning an ATMARP server to a network interface,
and displaying information about IP VCCs.
.PP
\fIMiscellaneous\fP subcommands allow for displaying the version
of the ATM software and for getting help with the \fIatm\fP command.
.SS "Signalling Managers"
The signalling manager is responsible for the opening and closing of
VCCs.
Four signalling managers are supported:
.PP
.in +10
.ti -5
PVC - for PVCs only,
.ti -5
SPANS - supports SPANS, FORE's proprietary signalling protocol,
.ti -5
UNI 3.0 - supports the signalling protocol from The ATM Forum's
\fIATM User-Network Interface Specification, Version 3.0\fP.
.ti -5
UNI 3.1 - supports the signalling protocol from The ATM Forum's
\fIATM User-Network Interface Specification, Version 3.1\fP.
.in -10
.PP
All four signalling managers support the opening and closing of PVCs
(see the \fIadd\fP and \fIdelete\fP subcommands).
.PP
A signalling manager must be attached to a physical interface
(see the \fIattach\fP subcommand)
before any VCCs can be created on the interface.
.SS "Physical and Network Interfaces"
Two types of interfaces are supported:
physical interfaces and network interfaces.
A physical interface represents a physical point of attachment to an
ATM network.
A physical interface has an ATM address associated with it, except
when the PVC-only signalling manager is being used.
.PP
A network interface is a logical interface.
One or more network interfaces are associated with a physical
interface;  each network interface has an IP address associated with it.
For UNI-controlled interfaces, there can be up to 256 network
interfaces associated with a physical interface.
In this case, the correspondence between the network interface and
the ATM address is determined by the selector field (the last
byte) of the physical interface's ATM address.
For PVC-only interfaces, there can be up to 256 logical interfaces
associated with each physical interface.
For interfaces controlled by the SPANS signalling manager,
there must be one and
only one network interface associated with each physical interface.
.SS "Keyword and Documentation Conventions"
Command and subcommand keywords can be abbreviated by simply giving
enough of the first part of the keyword to make it unique.
Thus, \fIatm sh v\fB gives the same result as \fIatm show vcc\fB.
.PP
All keywords are case-insensitive.
.PP
Where a host address needs to be given to the \fIatm\fP command,
either a DNS name or an IP address in dotted decimal format can
be used.
.PP
ATM addresses are specified as strings of hex digits, with an
optional leading "0x".
Fields within the address may be separated by periods, but periods
are for readability only and are ignored.
SPANS addresses are 8 bytes long, while NSAP-format addresses
are 20 bytes long.
The full address, including any leading zeroes, must be given.
For example:
.in +5
0x47.0005.80.ffe100.0000.f21a.0170.0020481a0170.00 (NSAP format)
.br
0x00000010.f2050aa9 (SPANS format)

.SH SUBCOMMANDS
.SS Interface Management Subcommands:
.in +5
.ti -5
\fIatm add PVC <interface> <vpi> <vci> <aal> <encaps> <owner> ...\fP
.in -5
.PP
the format of the \fIadd PVC\fP subcommand varies depending on the
owner of the PVC.
See the description under "IP Management Subcommands."
.PP
\fIatm attach <interface> <sigmgr>\fP
.PP
where:
.in +10
.ti -5
\fI<interface>\fP specifies the physical interface to which the
signalling manager is to be attached,
.ti -5
\fI<sigmgr>\fP specifies which signalling manager is to be attached.
Valid choices are "SIGPVC", "SPANS", "UNI30", and "UNI31".
.in -10
.PP
This command attaches a signalling manager to an interface.
Until this is done, VCCs cannot be opened or closed.
Only one signalling manager at a time can be attached to an interface.
.PP
\fIatm detach <interface>\fP
.PP
where:
.in +10
.ti -5
\fI<interface>\fP specifies the physical interface whose signalling
manager is to be detached.
.in -10
.PP
This command detaches a signalling manager from an interface.
All VCCs that the signalling manager has created will be closed,
and no new VCCs can be created until a signalling manager (either
the same or a different one) is attached again.
.PP
\fIatm set MAC <interface> <MAC/ESI address>\fP
.PP
where:
.in +10
.ti -5
\fI<interface>\fP specifies the physical interface whose
MAC address is to be set,
.ti -5
\fI<MAC/ESI address>\fP specifies the 6-byte MAC part of the NSAP
address for the interface.
The MAC address is specified as a string of 12 hexadecimal
digits with an optional leading "0x".
Fields in the address may be separated by periods.
.in -10
.PP
This command sets the MAC address for a UNI-controlled interface.
The first 13 bytes (the prefix) of the 20-byte NSAP-format address
are set by the \fIatm set prefix\fP command or the ILMI daemon
(\fIilmid\fP (8)),
the next 6 bytes (the End System Identifier (ESI)) are set by
this command,
and the last byte (the selector) will be determined by which
network interface is to be associated with the address.
.PP
The \fIatm set MAC\fP command can be used to override the MAC
address in the interface hardware.
.PP
\fIatm set netif <interface> <prefix> <count>\fP
.PP
where:
.in +10
.ti -5
\fI<interface>\fP specifies the physical interface that the network
interface(s) are to be associated with,
.ti -5
\fI<prefix>\fP specifies the invariant part of the network
interface name,
.ti -5
\fI<count>\fP specifies the number of network interface to be
created.
.in -10
.PP
This command creates one or more network interfaces and associates them
with the specified physical interface.
The network interface names are determined by the prefix and the count.
The names will be of the form <prefix><nn>, where <prefix> is the
prefix specified in the \fIset\fP subcommand and <nn> is a number
in the range 0 - <count>-1.  For example, the command:
.PP
.ti +5
atm set netif hfa0 ni 2
.PP
would create two network interfaces, named ni0 and ni1, and associate
them with physical interface hfa0.
.PP
\fIatm set prefix <interface> <NSAP prefix>\fP
.PP
where:
.in +10
.ti -5
\fI<interface>\fP specifies the physical interface whose NSAP
prefix is to be set,
.ti -5
\fI<NSAP prefix>\fP specifies the first 13 bytes of the NSAP address
for the interface.
The prefix is specified as a string of hexadecimal digits with an
optional leading "0x".
Fields in the prefix may be separated by periods.
.in -10
.PP
This command sets the address for a UNI-controlled interface.
The first 13 bytes (the prefix) of the 20-byte NSAP-format address
are set by this command,
the next 6 bytes (the End System Identifier (ESI)) will be the
MAC address taken from the physical interface or set by the
\fIset MAC\fP subcommand,
and the last byte (the selector) will be determined by which
network interface is to be associated with the address.
.PP
The NSAP prefix must be set before a UNI-controlled
interface can become active.
This can be accomplished either by the ILMI daemon (\fIilmid\fP (8))
or the \fIset prefix\fP subcommand.
