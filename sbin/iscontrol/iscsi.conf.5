.Sh NAME
.Nm iscsi.conf
.Nd key options to be negotiated in an iSCSI session
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The file
.Nm ,
is read by the
.Xr iscontrol 8
program.
It contains declarations and parameter/key-options.
The syntax is very simple,
.D1 Li variable = value;
and they can be grouped via a
.Em block
declaration:
.Bf Li
.Bd -literal
	# this is a comment
	target_1 { # nickname
	   variable = value;
	   ...
	} # this must be on a line by itself.
.Ed
.Ef
.Pp
The following are specified in the iSCSI RFC 3720,
for a full description see sections 11/12 of the RFC.
.Bl -tag -width MaxConnections
.It Cm AuthMethod
currently only supported authentication method is CHAP, with
digest either MD5 or SHA.
Default is none.
.It Cm HeaderDigest
a
.Em digest
is calculated on the header of all iSCSI PDUs, and
checked.
Only CRC32C is implemented.
Default is none.
.It Cm DataDigest
same as for HeaderDigest, but on the data part of the iSCSI PDU.
(not yet tested)
.It Cm MaxConnections
is the number of simultaneous connections per session,
currently only 1.
.It Cm TargetName
is the name by which the target is known, not to be confused with
target address, either obtained via the target administrator, or
from a
.Em discovery session .
.It Cm InitiatorName
if not specified, defaults to
.Sy iqn.2005-01.il.ac.huji.cs:
.Aq hostname .
.It Cm TargetAlias / InitiatorAlias
not implemented.
.It Cm TargetAddress
is of the form
.Sy domainname[:port][,portal-group-tag]
to quote the RFC:
.Bd -ragged -compact
The domainname can be specified as either a DNS host name, a
dotted-decimal IPv4 address, or a bracketed IPv6 address as specified
in [RFC2732].
.Ed
Note: portal-group-tag is unused at the moment.
.It Cm TargetPortalGroupTag
.Em not implemented yet.
.It Cm InitialR2T
.Em not implemented yet.
.It Cm ImmediateData
.Em not implemented yet.
.It Cm MaxRecvDataSegmentLength
the maximum data segment length in
bytes it can receive in an iSCSI PDU, default is 8192.
.It Cm MaxBurstLength
.Em not implemented yet.
.It Cm FirstBurstLength
.Em not implemented yet.
.It Cm DefaultTime2Wait
.Em not implemented yet.
.It Cm DefaultTime2Retain
.Em not implemented yet.
.It Cm MaxOutstandingR2T
is used to calculate/negotiate the
.Em tag opening ,
can be overridden by the
.Sy tag
option.
.It Cm DataPDUInOrder
.Em not implemented yet.
.It Cm DataSequenceInOrder
.Em not implemented yet.
.It Cm ErrorRecoveryLevel
Only level 0 is supported.
.It Cm SessionType
either Discovery or Normal, default is Normal, see the
.Fl d
flag of
.Cm iscontrol .
.El
.sp
The following are not specified in the
.Sy RFC 3720
.Bl -tag -width sockbufsize
.It Cm port
The iSCSI port used by the iSCSI protocol, defaults to 3260.
.It Cm tags
Sets the
.Em tag opening
to the value specified.
.It Cm maxluns
overrides the compiled value of
.Sy luns ,
see
.Xr iscsi_initiator 4 .
This value can only be reduced.
.It Cm sockbufsize
sets the receiver and transmitter socket buffer size to
.Em size ,
in kilobytes.
The default is 128.
.El
.sp
If
.Em AuthMethod
is set to
.Cm CHAP ,
then the following must also be set:
.Bl -tag -width chapSecret
.It Cm chapSecret
this
.Em shared-secret .
Can be either an ASCII string (e.g. hello world), a hex string (e.g
0xababcd0987654321...), or base64 string (eg 0b...)
.It Cm chapIName
the chap-name, defaults to
.Em hostname .
.It Cm chapDigest
can be MD5 or SHA1.
.It Cm tgtChapSecret/tgtChapName
same as the none
.Em tgt
counterpart, but to authenticate the target.

.Sh ERRORS
The parsing is very primitive, so do not expect - at the moment - any
error messages.

.Sh BUGS
Some options have not been implemented, either they were found
to be unnecessary, or not understood, this can change in the future.

The tags opening value is difficult to calculate, use wisely.
