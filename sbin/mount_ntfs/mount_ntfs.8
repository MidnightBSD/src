.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility attaches the NTFS file system residing on the device
.Pa special
to the global file system namespace at the location
indicated by
.Pa node .
This command is normally executed by
.Xr mount 8
at boot time, but can be used by any user to mount an
NTFS file system on any directory that they own (provided,
of course, that they have appropriate access to the device that
contains the file system).
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Force behaviour to return MS-DOS 8.3 names also on
.Fn readdir .
.It Fl i
Make name lookup case insensitive for all names except POSIX names.
.It Fl u Ar user
Set the owner of the files in the file system to
.Ar user .
The default owner is the owner of the directory
on which the file system is being mounted.
.It Fl g Ar group
Set the group of the files in the file system to
.Ar group .
The default group is the group of the directory
on which the file system is being mounted.
.It Fl m Ar mask
Specify the maximum file permissions for files
in the file system.
Only the nine low-order bits of
.Ar mask
are used.
.It Fl C Ar charset
Specify local
.Ar charset
to convert Unicode file names.
Currently only reading is supported, thus the file system is to be
mounted read-only.
.It Fl W Ar u2wtable
Specify
.Ux
to
.Tn Unicode
translation table.
See
.Xr mount_msdosfs 8
for the description of this option.
