.Sh NAME
.Nm etherswitchcfg
.Nd configure a built-in Ethernet switch
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl "f control file"
.Ar info
.Nm
.Op Fl "f control file"
.Ar config
.Ar command parameter
.Nm
.Op Fl "f control file"
.Ar phy
.Ar phy.register[=value]
.Nm
.Op Fl "f control file"
.Ar port%d
.Ar [flags] command parameter
.Nm
.Op Fl "f control file"
.Ar reg
.Ar register[=value]
.Nm
.Op Fl "f control file"
.Ar vlangroup%d
.Ar command parameter
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is used to configure an Ethernet switch built into the system.
.Nm
accepts a number of options:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width ".Fl f" -compact
.It Fl "f control file"
Specifies the
.Xr etherswitch 4
control file that represents the switch to be configured.
It defaults to
.Pa /dev/etherswitch0 .
.It Fl m
When reporting port information, also list available media options for
that port.
.It Fl v
Produce more verbose output.
Without this flag, lines that represent inactive or empty configuration
options are omitted.
.El
.Ss config
The config command provides access to global switch configuration
parameters.
It support the following commands:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width ".Ar vlan_mode mode" -compact
.It Ar vlan_mode mode
Sets the switch VLAN mode (depends on the hardware).
.El
.Ss phy
The phy command provides access to the registers of the PHYs attached
to or integrated into the switch controller.
PHY registers are specified as phy.register,
where
.Ar phy
is usually the port number, and
.Ar register
is the register number.
Both can be provided as decimal, octal or hexadecimal numbers in any of the formats
understood by
.Xr strtol 3 .
To set the register value, use the form instance.register=value.
.Ss port
The port command selects one of the ports of the switch.
It supports the following commands:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width ".Ar pvid number" -compact
.It Ar pvid number
Sets the default port VID that is used to process incoming frames that are not tagged.
.It Ar media mediaspec
Specifies the physical media configuration to be configured for a port.
.It Ar mediaopt mediaoption
Specifies a list of media options for a port.
See
.Xr ifconfig 8
for details on
.Ar media
and
.Ar mediaopt .
.El
.Pp
And the following flags (please note that not all flags
are supported by all switch drivers):
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width ".Ar addtag" -compact
.It Ar addtag
Add VLAN tag to each packet sent by the port.
.It Ar -addtag
Disable the add VLAN tag option.
.It Ar striptag
Strip the VLAN tags from the packets sent by the port.
.It Ar -striptag
Disable the strip VLAN tag option.
.It Ar firstlock
This options makes the switch port lock on the first MAC address it sees.
After that, usually you need to reset the switch to learn different
MAC addresses.
.It Ar -firstlock
Disable the first lock option.
Note that sometimes you need to reset the
switch to really disable this option.
.It Ar dropuntagged
Drop packets without a VLAN tag.
.It Ar -dropuntagged
Disable the drop untagged packets option.
.It Ar doubletag
Enable QinQ for the port.
.It Ar -doubletag
Disable QinQ for the port.
.It Ar ingress
Enable the ingress filter on the port.
.It Ar -ingress
Disable the ingress filter.
.El
.Ss reg
The reg command provides access to the registers of the switch controller.
.Ss vlangroup
The vlangroup command selects one of the VLAN groups for configuration.
It supports the following commands:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width ".Ar vlangroup" -compact
.It Ar vlan VID
Sets the VLAN ID (802.1q VID) for this VLAN group.
Frames transmitted on tagged member ports of this group will be tagged
with this VID.
Incoming frames carrying this tag will be forwarded according to the
configuration of this VLAN group.
.It Ar members port,...
Configures which ports are to be a member of this VLAN group.
The port numbers are given as a comma-separated list.
Each port can optionally be followed by
.Dq t
to indicate that frames on this port are tagged.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /dev/etherswitch? -compact
.It Pa /dev/etherswitch?
Control file for the Ethernet switch driver.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Configure VLAN group 1 with a VID of 2 and make ports 0 and 5 its members
while excluding all other ports.
Port 5 will send and receive tagged frames while port 0 will be untagged.
Incoming untagged frames on port 0 are assigned to vlangroup1.
