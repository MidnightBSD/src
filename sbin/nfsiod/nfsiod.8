.Sh NAME
.Nm nfsiod
.Nd local
.Tn NFS
asynchronous I/O server
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl n Ar num_servers
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is a kernel process which runs on an
.Tn NFS
client machine to service asynchronous I/O requests to its server.
It improves performance but is not required for correct operation.
.Pp
This program controls the maximum number of processes that the kernel runs.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl n
Specify how many servers are permitted to be started.
.El
.Pp
A client should run enough daemons to handle its maximum
level of concurrency, typically four to six.
.Pp
If
.Nm
detects that the running kernel does not include
.Tn NFS
support, it will attempt to load a loadable kernel module containing
.Tn NFS
code, using
.Xr kldload 2 .
If this fails, or no
.Tn NFS
KLD was available,
.Nm
exits with an error.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr nfsstat 1 ,
.Xr kldload 2 ,
.Xr nfssvc 2 ,
.Xr mountd 8 ,
.Xr nfsd 8 ,
.Xr rpcbind 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility first appeared in
.Bx 4.4 .
