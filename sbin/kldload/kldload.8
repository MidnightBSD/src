Note that if multiple modules are specified then an attempt will
be made to load them all, even if some fail.
The
.Pa .ko
extension name is not mandatory when loading a given module
using
.Nm .
It does not hurt to specify it though.
.Pp
The following option is available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl v
Be more verbose.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /boot/kernel -compact
.It Pa /boot/kernel
directory containing loadable modules.
Modules must have an extension of
.Pa .ko .

.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std

statement is used.
Modules may also be auto-loaded through their addition to
.Xr loader.conf 5 .
