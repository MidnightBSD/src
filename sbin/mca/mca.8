.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl d
.Op Fl f Ar filename
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility provides minimal functionality to dump or display MCA records
that were saved by the kernel during boot.
The default behaviour of the
.Nm
utility is to display all new MCA records on stdout.
When the
.Fl d
option is given, the records are dumped in binary form.
The default file to which records are dumped is
.Pa /var/log/mca.log .
This can be changed by specifying the
.Fl f
option.
New records are appended to the dump file.
.Pp
Previously dumped records can be displayed by giving the name of
the dump file with the
.Fl f
option.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width ".Pa /var/log/mca.log" -compact
.It Pa /var/log/mca.log
default dump file

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility appeared in
.Fx 5.0
for ia64.
.Sh BUGS
The development of the
.Nm
utility is still a work in progress.
