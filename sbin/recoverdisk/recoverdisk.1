.Sh NAME
.Nm recoverdisk
.Nd recover data from hard disk or optical media
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl r Ar rlist
.Op Fl w Ar wlist
.Ar special
.Op Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility reads data from the
.Ar special
file until all blocks could be successfully read.
It starts reading in multiples of the sector size.
Whenever a block fails, it is put to the end of the working queue and will be
read again, possibly with a smaller read size.
.Pp
It uses block sizes of roughly 1 MB, 64kB, and the native sector size (usually
512 bytes).
These figures are adjusted slightly, for devices whose sectorsize is not a
power of 2, e.g., audio CDs with a sector size of 2352 bytes.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl r Ar rlist
Read the list of blocks and block sizes to read from the specified file.
.It Fl w Ar wlist
Write the list of remaining blocks to read to the specified file if
.Nm
is aborted via
.Dv SIGINT .
.El
.Pp
The
.Fl r
and
.Fl w
options can be specified together.
Especially, they can point to the same file, which will be updated on abort.
.Sh OUTPUT
The
.Nm
utility
prints several columns, detailing the progress
.Bl -tag -width remaining
.It Va start
Starting offset of the current block.
.It Va size
Read size of the current block.
.It Va len
Length of the current block.
.It Va state
Is increased for every failed read.
.It Va done
Number of bytes already read.
.It Va remaining
Number of bytes remaining.
.It Va "% done"
Percent complete.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Bd -literal
# recover data from failing hard drive ad3
touch /data/lots_of_space
recoverdisk /dev/ad3 /data/lots_of_space

# clone a hard disk
recoverdisk /dev/ad3 /dev/ad4

# read an ISO image from a CD-ROM
touch /data/cd.iso; recoverdisk /dev/acd0 /data/cd.iso

# continue reading from a broken CD and update the existing worklist
recoverdisk -r worklist -w worklist /dev/acd0 /data/cd.iso

# recover a single file from the unreadable media
touch file.avi; recoverdisk /cdrom/file.avi file.avi

.Sh BUGS
Reading from media where the sectorsize is not a power of 2 will make all
1 MB reads fail.
This is due to the DMA reads being split up into blocks of at most 128kB.
These reads then fail if the sectorsize is not a divisor of 128kB.
When reading a full raw audio CD, this leads to roughly 700 error messages
flying by.
This is harmless.
