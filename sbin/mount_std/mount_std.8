.Sh NAME
.Nm mount_std ,
.Nm mount_devfs ,
.Nm mount_fdescfs ,
.Nm mount_linprocfs ,
.Nm mount_procfs
.Nd mount
.Dq standard
file systems
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm mount_ Ns Ar fsname
.Op Fl o Ar options
.Ar "fs"
.Ar mount_point
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is a generic mechanism for attaching ``standard'' file systems to
the file system.
The
.Nm
utility currently supports the following file systems:
.Nm devfs ,
.Nm fdescfs ,
.Nm linprocfs
and
.Nm procfs .
A ``standard'' file system is one which:
.Bl -enum -offset indent
.It
accepts only the standard
.Fl o
options
.Dq ro ,
.Dq rw ,
.Dq noexec ,
.Dq nosuid ,
and
.Dq union .
.It
has a kernel file system module name the same as its user-visible name.
.It
requires no other special processing on the part of the
.Nm
utility.
.El
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl o
Options are specified with a
.Fl o
flag followed by a comma separated string of options.
See the
.Xr mount 8
man page for possible options and their meanings.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility examines its zeroth command-line argument (the name by which
it was called) to determine the type of file system to be mounted.
If
it is called by a name which does not end in
.Dq Li _ Ns Ar fsname ,
.Nm
will assume (for compatibility
with
.Xr mount 8 )
that the zeroth argument contains only the name of the file system type.
The
.Nm
utility is normally installed with appropriate links to commands for
the distributed file systems which can be mounted in this way;
for information on the function of each file system, see the manual page
for that specific
.Nm mount_ Ns Ar fsname
utility.
.Pp
Refer to the following manual pages for detailed information
on these file systems:
.Xr devfs 5 ,
.Xr fdescfs 5 ,
.Xr linprocfs 5
and
.Xr procfs 5 .
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It argv[0] must end in _fsname
The
.Nm
utility was called with a zeroth argument of
.Dq Li mount_std .
.It %s file system not available
The specified file system type was not present in the kernel and no
loadable module for it was found.

utility first appeared in
