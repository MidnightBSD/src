Usage:  1. {PROGRAM} [OPTIONS] include INCLUDE-PATH ...
        2. {PROGRAM} [OPTIONS] exclude EXCLUDE-PATH ...

Read a Subversion revision log output stream from stdin, analyzing its
revision log history to see what paths would need to be additionally
provided as part of the list of included/excluded paths if trying to
use Subversion's 'svndumpfilter' program to include/exclude paths from
a full dump of a repository's history.

The revision log stream should be the result of 'svn log -v' or 'svn
log -vq' when run against the root of the repository whose history
will be filtered by a user with universal read access to the
repository's data.  Do not use the --use-merge-history (-g) or
--stop-on-copy when generating this revision log stream.
Use the default ordering of revisions (that is, '-r HEAD:0').

Return errorcode 0 if there are no additional dependencies found, 1 if
there were; any other errorcode indicates a fatal error.

Options:

   --help (-h)           Show this usage message and exit.

   --targets FILE        Read INCLUDE-PATHs and EXCLUDE-PATHs from FILE,
                         one path per line.

   --verbose (-v)        Provide more information.  May be used multiple
                         times for additional levels of information (-vv).
