	* Removed FILTER/ subdirectory.

	* Removed alloca.c.

	* Changed Makefile definition of CC to just "gcc -g", removed
	  assumption of alloca being present.

	* Added pointer to MISC/fastwc/ to wc.lex.

	* Changed main() in wc.lex extensively. The old version would not
	  work correctly without the YY_NEW_FILE. (lex handles the older
	  version OK though).

	* Added a rule to expr.lex to handle whitespace. The old version
 	  reported an illegal character.

	* Added -traditional to the gcc flags because the flex definition
	  for free() clashes with some systems that have old header files.
