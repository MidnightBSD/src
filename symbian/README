The PerlApp* files are a demonstration application for the CPerlBase
class, which is defined and implemented by the PerlBase* files. 
The rest of the files are part of the Symbian base port.

All files are Copyright (c) Nokia, 2004-2005, all rights reserved,
and licensed under the same terms as Perl itself.

Once the 'sdkinstall' make target has been run in the top level,
the PerlApp can be built using the standard Symbian way:

	bldmake bldfiles
	abld build wins udeb
	abld build thumb urel

and then packaged into a SIS by:

	makesis PerlApp.pkg
