/*
**  SHIELD AND CLOAKING DEVICE CONTROL
**
**	'f' is one for auto shield up (in case of Condition RED),
**	zero for shield control, and negative one for cloaking
**	device control.
**
**	Called with an 'up' or 'down' on the same line, it puts
**	the shields/cloak into the specified mode.  Otherwise it
**	reports to the user the current mode, and asks if she wishes
**	to change.
**
**	This is not a free move.  Hits that occur as a result of
**	this move appear as though the shields are half up/down,
**	so you get partial hits.
