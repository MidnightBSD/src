Hello. I've been using FreeBSD from version 1.0 1993 and very happy.
One of my favorite is /dev/speaker.  Here is my /dev/speaker
application named `piano' which is a piano/organ emulator.  I'd like
to contribute this program to FreeBSD if you like it.

This directory contains sources, Makefile and man page.

Make sure to config /dev/speaker and make it writable.  Please select
appropriate owner/group/mode for /dev/speaker and piano.
