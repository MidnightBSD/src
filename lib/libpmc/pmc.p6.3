.Ss Event Qualifiers
Event specifiers for Intel P6 PMCs can have the following common
qualifiers:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Li cmask= Ns Ar value
Configure the PMC to increment only if the number of configured
events measured in a cycle is greater than or equal to
.Ar value .
.It Li edge
Configure the PMC to count the number of de-asserted to asserted
transitions of the conditions expressed by the other qualifiers.
If specified, the counter will increment only once whenever a
condition becomes true, irrespective of the number of clocks during
which the condition remains true.
.It Li inv
Invert the sense of comparison when the
.Dq Li cmask
qualifier is present, making the counter increment when the number of
events per cycle is less than the value specified by the
.Dq Li cmask
qualifier.
.It Li os
Configure the PMC to count events happening at processor privilege
level 0.
.It Li umask= Ns Ar value
This qualifier is used to further qualify the event selected (see
below).
.It Li usr
Configure the PMC to count events occurring at privilege levels 1, 2
or 3.
