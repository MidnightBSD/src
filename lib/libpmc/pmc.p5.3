.Ss Event Qualifiers
Event specifiers for Intel Pentium PMCs can have the following common
qualifiers:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Li duration
Count duration (in clocks) of events.
The default is to count events.
.It Li os
Measure events at privilege levels 0, 1 and 2.
.It Li overflow
Assert the external processor pin associated with a counter on counter
overflow.
.It Li usr
Measure events at privilege level 3.
.El
.Pp
If neither of the

.Dq Li usr
qualifiers are specified, the default is to enable both.

Some events may only be used on specific counters and some events
are defined only on processors supporting the MMX instruction set.
Note that these PMCs do not have the ability to interrupt the CPU.
