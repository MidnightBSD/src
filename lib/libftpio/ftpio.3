.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions implement a high-level library for managing FTP connections.
.Pp
The
.Fn ftpLogin
function attempts to log in using the supplied
.Fa user ,
.Fa passwd ,
.Fa ftp_port
(if passed as 0,
.Fa ftp_port
defaults to the standard ftp port of 21) and
.Fa verbose
fields.
If it is successful, a
standard stream descriptor is returned which should be passed to
subsequent FTP operations.
On failure, NULL is returned and
.Fa retcode
will have the error code returned by the foreign server.
.Pp
The
.Fn ftpChdir
function attempts to issue a server CD command to the directory named in
.Fa dir .
On success, zero is returned.
On failure, the error code from the server.
.Pp
The
.Fn ftpErrno
function returns the server failure code for the last operation (useful for
seeing more about what happened if you are familiar with FTP error codes).
The
.Fn ftpErrString
function returns a human readable version of the supplied server failure code.
.Pp
The
.Fn ftpGet
function attempts to retrieve the file named by the
.Fa file
argument (which is assumed to be relative to the FTP server's current directory,
see
.Fn ftpChdir )
and returns a new FILE* pointer for the file or NULL on failure.
If
.Fa seekto
is non-NULL, the contents of the integer it points to will be used
as a restart point for the file, that is to say that the stream
returned will point
.Fa *seekto
bytes into the file gotten (this is handy for restarting failed
transfers efficiently).
If the seek operation fails, the value
of
.Fa *seekto
will be zero'd.
.Pp
The
.Fn ftpGetModtime
function returns the last modification time of the file named by the
.Fa file
argument.
If the file could not be opened or stat'd, 0 is returned.
.Pp
The
.Fn ftpGetSize
function returns the size in bytes of the file named by the
.Fa file
argument.
If the file could not be opened or stat'd, -1 is returned.
.Pp
The
.Fn ftpPut
function attempts to create a new file named by the
.Fa file
argument (which is assumed to be relative to the FTP server's current directory,
see
.Fn ftpChdir )
and returns a new
.Fa stream
pointer for the file or NULL on failure.
.Pp
The
.Fn ftpAscii
function sets
.Tn ASCII
mode for the current server connection named by
.Fa stream .
.Pp
The
.Fn ftpBinary
function sets binary mode for the current server connection named by
.Fa stream .
.Pp
The
.Fn ftpPassive
function sets passive mode (for firewalls) for the current server connection
named by
.Fa stream
to boolean value
.Fa status .
.Pp
The
.Fn ftpVerbose
function sets the verbosity mode for the current server connection named by
.Fa stream
to boolean value
.Fa status .
.Pp
The
.Fn ftpGetURL
function attempts to retrieve the file named by the supplied
.Fa URL
and can be considered equivalent to the combined
.Fn ftpLogin ,
.Fn ftpChdir
and
.Fn ftpGet
operations except that no server
.Fa stream
is ever returned - the connection to the server closes when
the file has been completely read.
Use the lower-level routines
if multiple gets are required as it will be far more efficient.
.Pp
The
.Fn ftpPutURL
function attempts to create the file named by the supplied
.Fa URL
and can be considered equivalent to the combined
.Fn ftpLogin ,
.Fn ftpChdir
and
.Fn ftpPut
operations except that no server stream is ever returned - the connection
to the server closes when the file has been completely written.
Use the
lower-level routines if multiple puts are required as it will be far more
efficient.
.Pp
The
.Fn ftpLoginAf ,
.Fn ftpGetURLAf ,
.Fn ftpPutURLAf
functions are same as
.Fn ftpLogin ,
.Fn ftpGetURL ,
.Fn ftpPutURL
except that they are able to specify address family
.Fa af .
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width FTP_PASSIVE_MODE -offset 3n
.It Ev FTP_TIMEOUT
Maximum time, in seconds, to wait for a response
from the peer before aborting an
.Tn FTP
connection.
.It Ev FTP_PASSIVE_MODE
If defined, forces the use of passive mode, unless equal
to ``NO'' or ``no'' in which case active mode is forced.
If defined, the setting of this variable always overrides any calls to
.Fn ftpPassive .
.El
.Sh HISTORY
Started life as Poul-Henning Kamp's ftp driver for the system installation
utility, later significantly mutated into a more general form as an
extension of stdio by Jordan Hubbard.
Also incorporates some ideas and
extensions from Jean-Marc Zucconi.

.Sh BUGS
I am sure you can get this thing's internal state machine confused if
you really work at it, but so far it has proven itself pretty robust in
all my tests.
