.Sh NAME
.Nm pam_nologin
.Nd NoLogin PAM module
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Op Ar service-name
.Ar module-type
.Ar control-flag
.Pa pam_nologin
.Op Ar options
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The NoLogin service module for PAM,
.Nm
provides the same functionality for two PAM categories:
authentication and account management.
In terms of the
.Ar module-type
parameter, those are the
.Dq Li auth
and
.Dq Li account
features.
It also provides a null function for session management.
.Ss NoLogin Authentication Module
The NoLogin authentication component,
.Fn pam_sm_authenticate ,
verifies whether logins are administratively disabled via
.Xr nologin 5 .
It returns success if the user's login class has an "ignorenologin"
capability specified in
.Xr login.conf 5
or the
.Xr nologin 5
file does not exist.
If neither condition is met,
then the contents of
.Xr nologin 5
are echoed
before failure is returned.
The location of
.Xr nologin 5
is specified by a "nologin" capability in
.Xr login.conf 5 ,
which defaults to
.Pa /var/run/nologin .
.Pp
The following options may be passed to the module:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm no_warn"
.It Cm debug
.Xr syslog 3
debugging information at
.Dv LOG_DEBUG
level.
.It Cm no_warn
suppress warning messages to the user.
These messages include
reasons why the user's
login attempt was declined.
.El
.Ss NoLogin Account Management Module
The NoLogin account management component,
.Fn pam_sm_acct_mgmt , 
returns the same value as the NoLogin authentication component
would return.
This component can be used to provide the NoLogin functionality
to services that skip PAM authentication.
