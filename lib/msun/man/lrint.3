.Sh NAME
.Nm llrint ,
.Nm llrintf ,
.Nm lrint ,
.Nm lrintf
.Nd "convert to integer"
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libm
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In math.h
.Ft "long long"
.Fn llrint "double x"
.Ft "long long"
.Fn llrintf "float x"
.Ft long
.Fn lrint "double x"
.Ft long
.Fn lrintf "float x"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn lrint
function returns the integer nearest to its argument
.Fa x
according to the current rounding mode.
If the rounded result is too large to be represented as a
.Vt long
value, an invalid exception is raised and the return value is undefined.
Otherwise, if
.Fa x
is not an integer,
.Fn lrint
raises an inexact exception.
When the rounded result is representable as a
.Vt long ,
the expression
.Fn lrint x
is equivalent to
.Po Vt long Pc Ns Fn rint x
(although the former may be more efficient).
.Pp
The
.Fn llrint ,
.Fn llrintf ,
and
.Fn lrintf
functions differ from
.Fn lrint
only in their input and output types.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr lround 3 ,
.Xr math 3 ,
.Xr rint 3 ,
.Xr round 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn llrint ,
.Fn llrintf ,
.Fn lrint ,
and
.Fn lrintf
functions conform to
.St -isoC-99 .
.Sh HISTORY
These routines first appeared in
.Fx 5.4 .
