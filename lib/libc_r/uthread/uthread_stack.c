 * stack.  When a new stack is created, a red zone is typically created
 * (actually, the red zone is simply left unmapped) above the top of the stack,
 * such that the stack will not be able to grow all the way to the bottom of the
 * next stack.  This isn't fool-proof.  It is possible for a stack to grow by a
 * large amount, such that it grows into the next stack, and as long as the
 * memory within the red zone is never accessed, nothing will prevent one thread
 * stack from trouncing all over the next.
