Revision history for Perl suite Locale::Maketext

2008-05-28  Adriano Ferreira
    * Release 1.13

    New maintainer. No noteworthy changes.

    When debugging is turned on, "DEBUG and warn" is now
    used instead of "DEBUG and print". It makes web applications
    happier. CPAN RT #36238
	
2007-11-17
    * Release 1.12

    Many doc changes from RT.

    Silenced some "used only once" warnings under Perl 5.10.

    $@ is now localized in case it gets interpolated.  This was added
    a while ago, but now there's a test for it, too.

    Added warnings and strict to tests.

    Cleaning up some Perl::Critic gripes.

2007-05-07  Andy Lester
    * Release 1.11_01

    Fixed perlbug #33938
    http://rt.perl.org/rt3//Public/Bug/Display.html?id=3393

    Started cleaning up source per Perl::Critic.


2005-11-10  Andy Lester
    * Release 1.10:

    New maintainer.  No changes at all.  Bumped up the version number
    and released it so that I can get the RT queue and any future mail.


2004-03-30  Sean M. Burke  sburke@cpan.org
    * Release 1.09:

    * Moved the language-preference-detecting code into new module
    I18N::LangTags::Detect.

    Thanks to Autrijus Tang for catching some errors in the dist!


2004-01-19  Sean M. Burke  sburke@cpan.org

    * Release 1.08:

    * Corrected a one-line code bug in v1.07 that accidentally demoted
    all en-* tags in cases of lexicon-groups that had an en.pm but no
    en_*.pm.  Thanks to Robert Spier for spotting this.  Test added.
    So don't use v1.07!

    * Autrijus found some typoes in the TPJ article.  Fixed.

2004-01-11  Sean M. Burke  sburke@cpan.org

    * Release 1.07:  Now uses a new and different rule for implicating
    superordinate language tags in accept-language lists.  Previously,
    superordinates were just tacked onto the, so "en-US, ja", turned
    into "en-US, ja, en".  However, this turned out to be suboptimal
    for many users of RT, a popular system using Maketext.  The new
    rule is that a tag implicates superordinate forms right after it,
    unless those tags are explicitly stated elsewhere in the
    accept-languages list.  So "en-US ja" becomes "en-US en ja".  If
    you want "en" to be really lower, you have to actually state it
    there: "en-US ja en" is left as-is.

    The 04super.t and 05super.t tests in t/ have many many examples of
    this, including some strange corner cases.

    (In implementing this change, I also refactored some code in
    Maketext.pm, for hopefully improved readability.  However,
    the above is the only actual change in behavior.)

2003-06-21  Sean M. Burke  sburke@cpan.org
    * Release 1.06:  Now has "use utf8" to make the things work
    happily.  Some fancy footwork is required to make this work under
    pre-utf8 perl versions.

2003-04-18  Sean M. Burke  sburke@cpan.org
    * Release 1.05:  Different Makefile.PL, same .pm code.

    Jesse Vincent, Hugo van der Sanden, and Jarkko Hietaniemi
    encourage me to add this to the makefile:
     ($] < 5.008) ? () : ( INSTALLDIRS => 'perl'),
    so that when you install this on a recent version of perl (5.8 or
    later), the installation will overwrite the Maketext.pm in your
    core library directory.  Email me if this produces trouble for any
    of you folks out there, okay?

2003-04-02  Sean M. Burke  sburke@cpan.org
    * Release 1.04: Implementing proper HTTP "tag;q=rank" parsing for
    get_handle.  This should make all the difference for users/victims
    of the current version of Safari, which uses that syntax as well
    as inserts random languages with low q numbers.
    Thanks to Jesse Vincent and the whole RT junta for finding this.

    * Added more tests, now in t/

    * Lots of typo fixes to Maketext.pm.  Thanks to Evan A. Zacks for
    patient help in finding them all.

2001-06-21  Sean M. Burke  sburke@cpan.org
    * Release 1.03: basically cosmetic tweaks to the docs and the
    test.pl.

2001-06-20  Sean M. Burke  sburke@cpan.org
    * Release 1.02:  EBCDIC-compatability changes courtesy of Peter
    Prymmer.  Added [*,...] as alias for [quant,...] and [#,...] as an
    alias for [numf,...].  Added some more things to test.pl

2001-05-25  Sean M. Burke  sburke@cpan.org
    * Release 1.01:  total rewrite.  Docs are massive now.
    Including TPJ13 article now.

2000-05-14  Sean M. Burke  sburke@cpan.org

    * Release 0.18:  only change, regrettably, is a better makefile,
    and it my email address has changed.

1999-03-15  Sean M. Burke  sburke@netadventure.net

    * Release 0.17:  Public alpha release
    Underdocumented.
