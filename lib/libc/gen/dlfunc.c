 * Implement the dlfunc() interface, which behaves exactly the same as
 * dlsym() except that it returns a function pointer instead of a data
 * pointer.  This can be used by applications to avoid compiler warnings
 * about undefined behavior, and is intended as prior art for future
 * POSIX standardization.  This function requires that all pointer types
 * have the same representation, which is true on all platforms FreeBSD
 * runs on, but is not guaranteed by the C standard.
