.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm readpassphrase
.Nd get a passphrase from the user
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In readpassphrase.h
.Ft "char *"
.Fn readpassphrase "const char *prompt" "char *buf" "size_t bufsiz" "int flags"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn readpassphrase
function displays a prompt to, and reads in a passphrase from,
.Pa /dev/tty .
If this file is inaccessible
and the
.Dv RPP_REQUIRE_TTY
flag is not set,
.Fn readpassphrase
displays the prompt on the standard error output and reads from the standard
input.
In this case it is generally not possible to turn off echo.
.Pp
Up to
.Fa bufsiz
\- 1 characters (one is for the
.Dv NUL )
are read into the provided buffer
.Fa buf .
Any additional
characters and the terminating newline (or return) character are discarded.
.Pp
The
.Fn readpassphrase
function
takes the following optional
.Fa flags :
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width ".Dv RPP_REQUIRE_TTY" -compact
.It Dv RPP_ECHO_OFF
turn off echo (default behavior)
.It Dv RPP_ECHO_ON
leave echo on
.It Dv RPP_REQUIRE_TTY
fail if there is no tty
.It Dv RPP_FORCELOWER
force input to lower case
.It Dv RPP_FORCEUPPER
force input to upper case
.It Dv RPP_SEVENBIT
strip the high bit from input
.El
.Pp
The calling process should zero the passphrase as soon as possible to
avoid leaving the cleartext passphrase visible in the process's address
space.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion,
.Fn readpassphrase
returns a pointer to the null-terminated passphrase.
If an error is encountered, the terminal state is restored and
a
.Dv NULL
pointer is returned.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width ".Pa /dev/tty" -compact
.It Pa /dev/tty
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following code fragment will read a passphrase from
.Pa /dev/tty
into the buffer
.Fa passbuf .
.Bd -literal -offset indent
char passbuf[1024];

\&...

if (readpassphrase("Response: ", passbuf, sizeof(passbuf),
    RPP_REQUIRE_TTY) == NULL)
	errx(1, "unable to read passphrase");

if (compare(transform(passbuf), epass) != 0)
	errx(1, "bad passphrase");

\&...

memset(passbuf, 0, sizeof(passbuf));
.Ed
.Sh SIGNALS
The
.Fn readpassphrase
function
will catch the following signals:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -compact
.It Dv SIGINT
.It Dv SIGHUP
.It Dv SIGQUIT
.It Dv SIGTERM
.It Dv SIGTSTP
.It Dv SIGTTIN
.It Dv SIGTTOU
.El
.Pp
When one of the above signals is intercepted, terminal echo will
be restored if it had previously been turned off.
If a signal handler was installed for the signal when
.Fn readpassphrase
was called that handler is then executed.
If no handler was previously installed for the signal then the
default action is taken as per
.Xr sigaction 2 .
.Pp
The
.Dv SIGTSTP , SIGTTIN ,
and
.Dv SIGTTOU
signals (stop signal generated from keyboard or due to terminal I/O
from a background process) are treated specially.
When the process is resumed after it has been stopped,
.Fn readpassphrase
will reprint the prompt and the user may then enter a passphrase.
.Sh ERRORS
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINTR
The
.Fn readpassphrase
function was interrupted by a signal.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The
.Fa bufsiz
argument was zero.
.It Bq Er EIO
The process is a member of a background process attempting to read
from its controlling terminal, the process is ignoring or blocking
the
.Dv SIGTTIN
signal or the process group is orphaned.
.It Bq Er EMFILE
The process has already reached its limit for open file descriptors.
.It Bq Er ENFILE
The system file table is full.
.It Bq Er ENOTTY
There is no controlling terminal and the
.Dv RPP_REQUIRE_TTY
flag was specified.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr sigaction 2 ,
.Xr getpass 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn readpassphrase
function is an
extension and should not be used if portability is desired.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn readpassphrase
function first appeared in
.Ox 2.9 .
