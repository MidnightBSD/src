.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/procctl.h
.Ft int
.Fn procctl "idtype_t idtype" "id_t id" "int cmd" "void *arg"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn procctl
system call provides for control over processes.
The
.Fa idtype
and
.Fa id
arguments specify the set of processes to control.
If multiple processes match the identifier,
.Nm
will make a
.Dq best effort
to control as many of the selected possibles as possible.
An error is only returned if no selected processes successfully complete
the request.
The following identifier types are supported:
.Bl -tag -width "Dv P_PGID"
.It Dv P_PID
Control the process with the process ID
.Fa id .
.It Dv P_PGID
Control processes belonging to the process group with the ID
.Fa id .
.El
.Pp
The control request to perform is specified by the
.Fa cmd
argument.
The following commands are supported:
.Bl -tag -width "Dv PROC_SPROTECT"
.It Dv PROC_SPROTECT
Set process protection state.
This is used to mark a process as protected from being killed if the system
exhausts available memory and swap.
The
.Fa arg
parameter must point to an integer containing an operation and zero or more
optional flags.
The following operations are supported:
.Bl -tag -width "Dv PPROT_CLEAR"
.It Dv PPROT_SET
Mark the selected processes as protected.
.It Dv PPROT_CLEAR
Clear the protected state of selected processes.
.El
.Pp
The following optional flags are supported:
.Bl -tag -width "Dv PPROT_DESCE"
.It Dv PPROT_DESCEND
Apply the requested operation to all child processes of each selected process
in addition to each selected process.
.It Dv PPROT_INHERIT
When used with
.Dv PPROT_SET ,
mark all future child processes of each selected process as protected.
Future child processes will also mark all of their future child processes.
.El

.Sh RETURN VALUES
If an error occurs, a value of -1 is returned and
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn procctl
system call
will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EFAULT
The
.Fa arg
points outside the process's allocated address space.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The
.Fa cmd
argument specifies an unsupported command.
.Pp
The
.Fa idtype
argument specifies an unsupported identifier type.
.It Bq Er EPERM
The calling process does not have permission to perform the requested
operation on any of the selected processes.
.It Bq Er ESRCH
No processes matched the requested
.Fa idtype
and
.Fa id .
.It Bq Er EINVAL
An invalid operation or flag was passed in
.Fa arg
for a
.Dv PROC_SPROTECT
command.
