	** The following expression rounds twice, which means

	** For example, suppose time_t is 64-bit signed int,
	** long_double is IEEE 754 double with default rounding,
	** time1 = 9223372036854775807 and time0 = -1536.
	** Then the true difference is 9223372036854777343,
	** which rounds to 9223372036854777856
	** with a total error of 513.
	** But delta overflows to -9223372036854774273,
	** which rounds to -9223372036854774784, and correcting
	** this by subtracting 2 * (long_double) hibit
	** (i.e. by adding 2**64 = 18446744073709551616)
	** yields 9223372036854776832, which
	** rounds to 9223372036854775808
	** with a total error of 1535 instead.
	** This problem occurs only with very large differences.
	** It's too painful to fix this portably.
	** We are not alone in this problem;
	** some C compilers round twice when converting
	** large unsigned types to small floating types,
	** so if time_t is unsigned the "return delta" above
	** has the same double-rounding problem with those compilers.
