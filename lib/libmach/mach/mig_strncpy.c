 * mig_strncpy.c - by Joshua Block
 *
 * mig_strncpy -- Bounded string copy.  Does what the library routine strncpy
 * OUGHT to do:  Copies the (null terminated) string in src into dest, a 
 * buffer of length len.  Assures that the copy is still null terminated
 * and doesn't overflow the buffer, truncating the copy if necessary.
 *
 * Parameters:
 * 
 *     dest - Pointer to destination buffer.
 * 
 *     src - Pointer to source string.
 * 
 *     len - Length of destination buffer.
 *
 * Result:
 *	length of string copied, INCLUDING the trailing 0.
