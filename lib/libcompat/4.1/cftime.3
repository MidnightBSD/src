.Os
.Dt CFTIME 3
.Sh NAME
.Nm cftime ,
.Nm ascftime
.Nd convert date and time to string
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libcompat
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In time.h
.Ft int
.Fn cftime "char *s" "char *format" "const time_t *clock"
.Ft int
.Fn ascftime "char *s" "const char *format" "const struct tm *tmptr"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Bf -symbolic
The
.Fn cftime
and
.Fn ascftime
functions are made obsolete by
.Xr strftime 3 .
.Ef
.Pp
Use of the functions
.Fn cftime
and
.Fn ascftime
is strongly deprecated, since there is no way to check for a buffer
overflow condition.
Use
.Xr strftime 3
instead.
.Pp
The
.Fn ascftime
function is almost identical to
.Xr strftime 3 ,
with the only exception that there is no parameter to tell about the
maximal buffer length, and the
.Fa format
parameter defaults to
.Dq %C
if a
.Em NULL
pointer is given.
.Pp
The
.Fn cftime
function does the same job, but it first invokes
.Xr localtime 3
in order to convert the given
.Fa clock ,
then also performs the conversions as requested by the
.Fa format
argument.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn cftime
and
.Fn ascftime
functions return the number of characters written to the output
buffer
.Fa s ,
not counting the trailing null character.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr localtime 3 ,
.Xr strftime 3
