.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm libefi
library provides access to a select set of the runtime services of the
Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI).
.Pp
The
.Fn efi_nextvarname
function is used to enumerate the variables.
The
.Fa namesize
parameter needs to be set to the size of the buffer pointed to by
.Fa name .
On return,
.Fa namesize
is set to the length of the variable name (including the terminating
.Ql \e0 )
irrespective of whether the buffer was big enough.
The buffer pointed to by
.Fa name
contains the full or partial variable name on return.
Only on successful completion of the request is the
.Fa vendor
updated.
The values returned should be passed to successive calls to
.Fn efi_nextvarname
until all variables have been enumerated.
.Pp
The variable name and vendor as returned by
.Fn efi_nextvarname
can be passed to
.Fn efi_getvar
to obtain the value and attribute of the variable.
The buffer that is to contain the value is specified by
.Fa data
and the size of the buffer is given by
.Fa datasize .
The attribute pointed to by
.Fa attrib
consists of the bit values defined by the EFI specification.
.Pp
Variables can be created, modified and deleted using the
.Fn efi_setvar
function.
All new variables must be non-volatile and runtime accessible in
order for the request to succeed.
Note that for runtime accessable variables the boottime accessable bit must
be set as well.
To delete a variable, set
.Fa datasize
to 0.
.Pp
The vendor UUID is used to avoid collisions between variable names of
different vendors.
Variables created for use by
.Fx
should use the
.Dv EFI_FREEBSD_VARIABLE
UUID as defined in the
.In libefi.h
header file.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, these functions return 0.
Otherwise, the error number is returned.
These functions will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EACCES
Insufficient permissions to access the EFI services.
.It Bq Er EILSEQ
The variable name is not in UTF-8.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The request has invalid parameters.
.It Bq Er ENOENT
The variable does not exist or no more variables exist.
.It Bq Er ENOMEM
Temporary storage could not be allocated.
.It Bq Er EOVERFLOW
The variable name is too long or the data is too big to fit in
the buffer provided.
