.Sh NAME
.Nm libthr
.Nd "alternative POSIX threads library"
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libthr
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In pthread.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
library provides an alternative 1:1 implementation of the
.Xr pthread 3
library interfaces for application threading.
While applications may be linked directly against
.Nm ,
system administrators are offered maximum flexibility by linking against
.Xr pthread 3 ,
as they can then use
.Xr libmap.conf 5
to select the threading implementation on a per-application basis.
.Pp
The
.Nm
library
has been optimized for use by applications expecting system scope thread
semantics, and can provide significant performance improvements.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr pthread 3
