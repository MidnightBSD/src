.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm easprintf ,
.Nm efopen ,
.Nm ecalloc ,
.Nm emalloc ,
.Nm erealloc ,
.Nm estrdup ,
.Nm estrlcat ,
.Nm estrlcpy ,
and
.Nm evasprintf
functions
operate exactly as the correspoding functions that do not start with an
.Sq e
except that they call
the installed error handler that can be configured with
.Nm esetfunc .
The default error handler is
.Xr err 3 .
The function
.Nm esetfunc
returns the previous error handler function.
A
.Dv NULL
error handler will just call
.Xr exit 3 .
