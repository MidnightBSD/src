.Dt LOGIN 3
.Sh NAME
.Nm login
.Nd "log a new login record to the utmp and wtmp files"
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libutil
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In utmp.h
.In libutil.h
.Ft void
.Fn login "struct utmp *ut"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The function
.Fn login
records the
.Ar ut
entry being passed into the appropriate slot of the
.Xr utmp 5
file,
and appends it to the
.Xr wtmp 5
file.
The calling process must have permission to write to both files.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
None.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr logout 3 ,
.Xr ttyslot 3 ,
.Xr utmp 5 ,
.Xr wtmp 5
.Sh BUGS
The interface provided by
.Fn login
is rather crude.
The caller must know about the details of a
.Va struct utmp .
Some better abstraction needs to be worked out.
