# DNSSD Client Library

The DNSSD client library allows applications to make use of the services provided by mDNSResponder:
* publishing services using DNS-SD
* browsing services advertised with DNS-SD
* resolving an individual service using DNS-SD once it has been selected

Documentation for the library can be found in [its header file](../mDNSShared/dns_sd.h).
