  <title>Supported Processors and Motherboards</title>

  <para>Since mid-2003 &os;/&arch; has supported the &arch.print;
    (<quote>Hammer</quote>) and Intel EM64T architecture,
    and is now one of the Tier-1 platforms (fully
    supported architecture), which are expected to be Production
    Quality with respects to all aspects of the &os; operating system,
    including installation and development environments.</para>

  <para>Note that there are two names for this architecture,
    AMD64 (AMD) and Intel EM64T (Extended Memory 64-bit Technology).
    64-bit mode of the two architectures are almost compatible
    with each other, and &os;/&arch; should support them both.</para>

  <para>As of this writing, the following processors are
    supported:</para>

  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>AMD Athlon64 (<quote>Clawhammer</quote>).</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>AMD Opteron (<quote>Sledgehammer</quote>).</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>Intel 64-bit Xeon (<quote>Nacona</quote>).
	This processor is fabricated on 90nm process technology, and operates
	with 2.80 to 3.60 GHz (FSB 800MHz) and Intel E7520/E7525/E7320 chipsets.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>Intel Pentium 4 Processor supporting Intel EM64T
	(<quote>Prescott</quote>).
	This is fabricated on 90nm process technology,
	uses FC-LGA775 package, and operates with 3.20F/3.40F/3.60F GHz
	and Intel 925X Express chipsets.
	The corresponding S-Spec numbers are SL7L9, SL7L8, SL7LA, SL7NZ, SL7PZ,
	and SL7PX.  Note that processors marked as 5xx numbers do not support
	EM64T.</para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <para>Intel EM64T is an extended version of IA-32 (x86) and
    different from Intel IA-64 (Itanium) architecture, which &os;/ia64
    supports.  Some Intel's old documentation refers to Intel EM64T as
    <quote>64-bit extension technology</quote> or <quote>IA-32e</quote>.</para>

  <para>The largest tested
    memory configuration to date is 8GB.  SMP support has been
    recently completed and is reasonably robust.</para>

  <para>In many respects, &os;/&arch; is similar to &os;/i386, in
    terms of drivers supported.  There may be some issues with 64-bit
    cleanliness in some (particularly older) drivers.  Generally,
    drivers that already function correctly on other 64-bit platforms
    should work.</para>

  <para>&os;/&arch; is a very young platform on &os;.  While the
    core &os; kernel and base system components are generally
    fairly robust, there are likely to still be rough edges,
    particularly with third party packages.</para>
