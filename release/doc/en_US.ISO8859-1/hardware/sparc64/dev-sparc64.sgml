  <title>Supported Devices</title>

  <para>This section describes the devices currently known to be
    supported by with &os; on the &arch.print; platform.  Other
    configurations may also work, but simply have not been tested yet.
    Feedback, updates, and corrections to this list are
    encouraged.</para>

  <para>Where possible, the drivers applicable to each device or class
    of devices is listed.  If the driver in question has a manual page
    in the &os; base distribution (most should), it is referenced
    here.</para>

  <sect2>
    <title>PCI Hardware</title>

    <para>In general, any device for which there is a driver can be
      made to work on sparc64. Some drivers might just work, others
      might require some changes (because this is the first big-endian
      architecture to be supported by &os;).</para>

    <para>The following drivers are known to work:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para><literal>apb</literal> (Sun PCI-PCI
        bridge)</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>generic PCI-PCI bridges</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>&man.ahc.4; (coming real soon).</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>&man.ata.4;, <devicename>atadisk</devicename>,
        <devicename>atapicd</devicename> (but not atapifd,
        atapist)</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>&man.gem.4; (Sun GEM/ERI ethernet,
        on-board on Blade 100)</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>&man.hme.4; (Sun HME ethernet,
        on-board on Ultra 5, 10)</para></listitem>

    <title>SBus Hardware</title>

    <para>The following drivers have SBus front ends:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para><literal>hme</literal> Ethernet</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para><literal>mk48txx</literal>
	  (<quote>eeprom</quote> device; time-of-day clock)</para></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
  </sect2>

  <sect2>
    <title>ISA Hardware</title>

    <para>The paragraph about PCI drivers apply to ISA drivers as
      well, but with the notable exception that ISA DMA is not yet
      supported.  This are generally on-board devices; there are no
      &tm.ultrasparc; boxes with ISA slots that the authors are aware
      of.</para>

    <para>The following drivers are known to work:</para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para>&man.sio.4;</para></listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
  </sect2>

  <sect2>
    <title>EBus Hardware</title>

    <para>The EBus is specific to Sun hardware, so drivers need to
      have support added to work with these devices. It is quite
      similar to ISA, so that ISA drivers can usually be easily
      ported, provided that they use the bus space interface, and not
      in[bwl]/out[bwl] and related functions. DMA is not yet
      supported.</para>

    <para>The following drivers are known to work:</para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para>&man.sio.4;</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para><literal>mk48txx</literal> ('eeprom' device;
          time-of-day clock)</para></listitem>

    <title>Unsupported Hardware</title>

    <para>The following hardware, which is built-in in Sun &tm.ultrasparc;
      boxes, is not currently supported:</para>

        indirectly in text mode using the
        <devicename>ofw_console</devicename> device)</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>Siemens sab82532 serial ports (Ultra 5/10; the
        keyboard/mouse ports are also RS232 ones and supported by the
        sio driver though; a driver, 'se', is being worked
        on).</para></listitem>
