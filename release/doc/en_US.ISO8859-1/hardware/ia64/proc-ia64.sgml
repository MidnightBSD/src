  <title>Supported Processors and Motherboards</title>

  <para>Currently supported processors are the

    and the <ulink url="http://www.intel.com/design/itanium2/index.htm">Itanium 2</ulink>.</para>

  <para>Both Uniprocessor (UP) and Symmetric Multi-processor (SMP)
    configurations are under active development.  At this time,
    SMP-enabled systems are considered less stable.  The current
    priorities are UP fixes to improve stability.</para>

    <title>Supported Devices Overview</title>

    <para>This section contains additional information about what
      devices may or may not be supported by &os;/&arch;.</para>

    <para>Except for the PC chipset embedded &man.ata.4; controllers,
      most should work out of the box.  Eventually, all
      &arch;-compatible ATA controllers are expected to be fully
      supported.  Refer to the following sections for various disk
      controllers and their current status.</para>
    
    <para>In general, <quote>PC standard</quote> serial ports
      supported by the &man.sio.4; driver are expected to work on
      Intel legacy machines, but not PA legacy machines.  The reason
      is that all devices on HP machines are memory-mapped and there
      is <emphasis>no</emphasis> ISA device support other than the PCI
      dictated VGA legacy.</para>

    <para>In addition to &man.sio.4; devices, the following devices
      fail on non-Intel legacy machines (but should work on boxes with
      an Intel legacy) because their drivers make ISA-specific
      assumptions that do not hold:</para>
