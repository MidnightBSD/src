  <title>Supported Processors and Motherboards</title>

  <para>Currently supported processors are the

    <title>Supported Devices Overview</title>

    <para>Most devices that can be found in or are compatible with
      &arch; machines are fully supported.  The notable exception
      is the VGA console. The &os; support for VGA consoles is at
      this time too much based on PC hardware and not all &arch;
      machines have chipsets that provide sufficient PC legacy
      support. As such &man.syscons.4; can not be enabled and the
      use of a serial console is required.</para>
