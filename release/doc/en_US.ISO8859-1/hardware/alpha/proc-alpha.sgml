    <title>Overview</title>

    <para>This document tries to provide a starting point for those
    who want to run &os; on an Alpha-based machine. It is
    aimed at providing background information on the various hardware
    designs. It is not a replacement for the systems manuals.</para>

    <para>The information is structured as follows:</para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
	  <para>general hardware requirements to run &os; on alpha;</para>
	</listitem>
        <listitem>

          systems/boards supported  by &os;;</para>

	  <para>information on expansion boards for &os;,
	  including things that differ from what is in the generic
	  supported hardware list.</para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

    <note>
      <para>You will see references to DEC, Digital Equipment Corporation and 
      Compaq used more or less interchangeably. Now that Compaq has acquired 
      Digital Equipment it would be more correct to refer to Compaq only.
      To be completely politically correct given that Hewlett Packard 
      in turn has acquired Compaq I probably should be using HP everywhere.
      Given the fact that you will see the mix of names everywhere, I don't
      bother.</para>

      <para>SRM commands will be in <userinput>UPPER CASE</userinput>. 
      Lower case input is also acceptable to SRM. Upper case is used for

  <sect2>
    <title>In general, what do you need to run &os; on an Alpha?</title>

    <para>Obviously you will need an Alpha machine that &os;
    knows about.  Alpha machines are NOT like PCs. There are
    considerable differences between the various core logic chip sets and
    mainboard designs. This means that a kernel needs to know the
    intimate details of a particular machine before it can run on
    it. Throwing some odd <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel at
    unknown hardware is almost guaranteed to fail miserably.</para>

    <para>For a machine even to be considered for &os; use please
    make sure it has the SRM console firmware installed. Or at least
    make sure that SRM console firmware is available for the
    particular machine type. If &os; does not currently support
    your machine type, there is a good chance that this will change at
    some point in time, assuming SRM is available. All bets are off when
    SRM console firmware is not available.</para>

    <para>Machines with the ARC or AlphaBIOS console firmware were
    intended for WindowsNT. Some have SRM console firmware available
    in the system ROMs which you only have to select (via an ARC or
    AlphaBIOS menu). In other cases you will have to re-flash the ROMs
    with SRM code. Check on
    http://ftp.digital.com/pub/DEC/Alpha/firmware to see what is
    available for your particular system. In any case: no SRM means 
    <emphasis>no</emphasis>
    &os; (or NetBSD, OpenBSD, Tru64 Unix or OpenVMS for that
    matter). With the demise of WindowsNT/alpha a lot of former NT
    boxes are sold on the second hand market. They have little or no
    trade-in value when they are NT-only from the console firmware
    perspective. So, be suspicious if the price appears too good.</para>
    
    <para>In case you have problems making your selection of SRM
    'stick', in other words if the system falls back to AlphaBIOS
    after you selected the SRM console, it is time to check if the
    battery of your CMOS clock/parameter RAM is empty.  If so,
    a replacement battery most likely fixes the issue.</para>

    <para>Known non-SRM machines are:</para>

         </listitem>
       </itemizedlist>
    
    <para>To complicate things a bit further: Digital used to have so
    called <quote>white-box</quote> Alpha machines destined as NT-only
    and <quote>blue-box</quote> Alpha machines destined for OpenVMS
    and Digital Unix. These names are based on the color of the
    cabinets, <quote>FrostWhite</quote> and <quote>TopGunBlue</quote>
    respectively.  Although you could put the SRM console firmware on a
    whitebox, OpenVMS and Digital Unix will refuse to boot on
    them. &os; in post-4.0-RELEASE will run on both the white and the
    blue-box variants. Before someone asks: the white ones had a
    rather different (read: cheaper) Digital price tag.</para>

    <para>As part of the SRM you will get the so called OSF/1 PAL code
    (OSF/1 being the initial name of Digital's UNIX offering on
    Alpha). The PAL code can be thought of as a software abstraction
    layer between the hardware and the operating system. It uses
    normal CPU instruction plus a handful of privileged instructions
    specific for PAL use. PAL is not microcode.  The ARC console
    firmware contains a different PAL code, geared towards WinNT and
    in no way suitable for use by &os; (or more generic: Unix or
    OpenVMS).  Before someone asks: Linux/alpha brings its own PAL
    code, allowing it to boot on ARC and AlphaBIOS. There are various
    reasons why this is not a very good idea in the eyes of the *BSD
    folks. I don't want to go into details here. If you are interested
    in the gory details search the &os; and NetBSD web sites.</para>

    <para>There is another pitfall ahead: you will need a disk adapter
    that the SRM console firmware recognizes in order to be able to boot from
    a disk. What is acceptable to SRM as a boot adapter is
    unfortunately highly system and SRM version dependent. For older PCI
    based machines it means you will need either a NCR/Symbios
    53C810 based adapter, or a Qlogic 1020/1040 based adapter.  Some
    machines come with a SCSI chip embedded on the mainboard. Newer
    machine designs and SRM versions will be able to work with more modern
    SCSI chips/adapters.  Check out the machine specific info
    below. Please note that the rest of this discussion only refers to
    Symbios chips, this is meant to include the older chips that still
    have NCR stamped on them. Symbios bought NCR sometime.</para>

    <para>The problem might bite those who have machines that started
    their lives as WindowsNT boxes. The ARC or AlphaBIOS knows about
    <emphasis>other</emphasis> adapter types that it can boot from
    than the SRM. For example you can boot from an Adaptec 2940UW with
    ARC/AlphaBios but (generally) not with SRM. Some newer machine types have
    introduced Adaptec boot support. Please consult the machine
    specific section for details.</para>

    <para>Most adapters that cannot be booted from work fine for
    data-only disks.  The differences between SRM and ARC could also
    get you pre-packaged IDE CDROMs and hard drives in some (former
    WindowsNT) systems.  SRM versions exist (depends on the machine type)
    that can boot from IDE disks and CDROMs. Check the machine
    specific section for details.</para>

    <para>In order to be bootable the root partition (partition a)
    must be at offset 0 of the disk drive. This means you have to 
    use the installer's partitioning menu and start with assigning 
    partition a at offset 0 to the root partition. Subsequently layout
    the rest of the partitions to your liking. If you do not adhere
    to this rule the install will proceed just fine, but the system
    will not be bootable from the freshly installed disk. Note that
    fdisk is not used on &os; running on Alpha, disks are directly
    labeled using disklabel.</para>

    <para>If you don't have/want a local disk drive you can boot via
    the Ethernet.  This assumes an Ethernet adapter/chip that is
    recognized by the SRM console. Generally speaking this boils down to
    either a 21040 or 21142 or 21143 based Ethernet interface. Older
    machines or SRM versions may not recognize the 21142 / 21143 Fast
    Ethernet chips, you are then limited to using 10Mbit Ethernet for net
    booting those machines. Non-DEC cards based on said chips will
    generally (but are not guaranteed to) work. Note that Intel took
    over the 21x4x chips when it bought Digital Semiconductor. So you
    might see an Intel logo on them these days. Recent machine designs
    have SRM support for Intel 8255x Ethernet chips.</para>

    <para>Alpha machines can be run with SRM on a graphics console or
    on a serial console. ARC can also be run on a serial consoles if need
    be. VT100 emulation with 8 bit controls should at least allow you
    to switch from ARC/AlphaBIOS to SRM mode without having to install a
    graphics card first.</para>

    <para>If you want to run your Alpha machine without a monitor/graphics
    card just don't connect a keyboard/mouse to the machine. Instead
    hook up a serial terminal[emulator] to serial port #1.  The SRM
    will talk 9600N81 to you. This can also be really practical for
    debugging purposes. Beware: some/most (?) SRMs will also present
    you with a console prompt at serial port #2. The booting kernel,
    however, will display the boot messages on serial port #1 and will
    also put the console there. <emphasis>This can be extremely 
    confusing.</emphasis></para>

    <para>Most PCI based Alphas can use ordinary PC-type VGA
    cards. The SRM contains enough smarts to make that work. It does
    not, however, mean that each and every PCI VGA card out on the
    street will work in an Alpha machine. Things like S3 Trio64,
    Mach64, and Matrox Millennium generally work. Old ET4000 based ISA
    cards have also worked for me. But ask around first before buying.</para>

    <para>Most PCI devices from the PC-world will also work in
    &os; PCI-based machines. Check the
    <filename>/sys/alpha/conf/GENERIC</filename> file for the latest word
    on this. Check the appropriate machine type's
    discussion in case you want to use PCI cards that have PCI bridge
    chips on them. In some cases you might encounter problems with
    PCI cards not handling PCI parity correctly. This can lead to
    panics. PCI parity checking can be disabled using the following
    SRM command:</para>

    <screen><prompt>&gt;&gt;&gt;</prompt> <userinput>SET PCI_PARITY OFF</userinput></screen>

    <para>This is not a &os; problem, all operating systems running on 
    Alpha hardware will need this workaround.</para>

    <para>If your system (also) contains EISA expansion slots you will
    need to run the EISA Configuration Utility (ECU) after you have
    installed EISA cards or after you have upgraded your 
    console firmware.</para>

    <para>For Alpha CPUs you will find multiple generations. The
    original Alpha design is the 21064. It was produced in a chip
    process called MOS4, chips made in this process are nicknamed
    EV4. Newer CPUs are 21164, 21264 etc. You will see designations
    like EV4S, EV45, EV5, EV56, EV6, EV67, EV68.  The EVs with double digit
    numbers are slightly improved versions. For example EV45 has an
    improved FPU and 16 kByte on-chip separate I &amp; D caches compared
    to the EV4 on which it is based. Rule of thumb: the higher the
    digit immediately following <quote>EV</quote> the more desirable
    (read: faster / more modern).  Spending money on anything less than
    an EV5 is not recommended.  Hardware available for free is a different 
    matter of course.</para>

    <para>For memory you want at least 32 Mbytes. I have had
    &os; run on a 16 Mbyte system years ago but you will not enjoy
    that. Kernel build times halved when I went to 32 Mbytes. Note that
    the SRM console steals 2Mbyte from the total system memory (and keeps
    it). For more serious work 128 Mbytes or more are recommended.
    Although Alpha machines typically can accommodate large to very large
    physical memory sizes, &os; is limited to 1 or 2 Gbytes (dependent
    on the core chipset) of RAM. This restriction is due to the
    current implementation of the VM system.</para>

    <para>While on the subject of memory: pay close attention to the
    type of memory your machine uses. There are very different memory
    configurations and requirements for the various machines.</para>

    <para>Final word: I expect the above to sound a bit daunting to
    the first-time Alpha user. Don't be daunted too much. And do feel
    free to ask questions if something is not clear after reading this
    document.</para>

    <title>System-specific information</title>

    <para>Below is an overview of the hardware that &os; runs on. This list 
    will definitely grow, a look in 
    <filename>/sys/alpha/conf/GENERIC</filename> can be enlightening.</para>
 
    <para>Alpha machines are often best known by their project code name. 
    Where known these are listed below in parentheses.</para>

    <sect3>    
      <title>AXPpci33 (<quote>NoName</quote>)</title>

      <para>The NoName is a baby-AT mainboard based on the 21066 LCA
      (Low Cost Alpha) processor. NoName was originally designed for
      OEM-use. The LCA chip includes almost all of the logic to drive
      a PCI bus and the memory subsystem.  All of this makes for a
      low-priced design.</para>

      <para>Due to the limited memory interface the system is not
      particularly fast in case of cache misses. As long as you stay
      inside the on-chip cache the CPU is comparable to a 21064 (first
      generation Alpha). These boards should be very cheap to obtain
      these days. It is a full-fledged 64 bit CPU, just don't expect
      miracles as far as speed goes.</para>

      <para>NoNames can either have SRM <emphasis>or</emphasis> ARC console
      firmware in their Flash ROM.  The Flash ROM is not big enough to
      hold both ARC and SRM at the same time and allow software
      selection of alternate console code. But you only need SRM
      anyway.</para>

      <para>Cache for the NoNames are 15 or 20 ns DIL chips. For a 256
      kByte cache you want to check your junked 486 mainboard. Chips
      for a 1 Mbyte cache are a rarer breed unfortunately. Getting at
      least a 256kByte cache is recommended performance
      wise. Cache-less they are really slow.</para>

      <para>The NoName mainboard has a PC/AT-standard power
      connector. It also has a power connector for 3.3 Volts. No need
      to rush out to get a new power supply. The 3.3 Volts is only
      needed in case you run 3.3 Volts PCI expansion boards. These are
      quite rare.</para>

      <para>The IDE interface is supported by &os; and requires a
      line in the kernel configuration file as follows:</para>

      <programlisting>device ata</programlisting>

      <para>The ATA interface uses irq 14.</para>

      <para>The SRM console unfortunately <emphasis> cannot boot</emphasis>
      from IDE disks. This means you will have to use a SCSI disk as
      the boot device.</para>

      <para>The NoName is somewhat stubborn when it comes to serial
      consoles. It needs</para>
      <screen>&gt;&gt;&gt; <userinput>SET CONSOLE SERIAL</userinput></screen>
      <para>before it goes for a serial console. Pulling the keyboard from 
      the machine is not sufficient, like it is on most other Alpha models. 
      Going back to a graphical console needs</para>
      <screen>&gt;&gt;&gt; <userinput>SET CONSOLE GRAPHICS</userinput></screen>
      <para>at the serial console.</para>

      <para>There have been reports that you sometimes need to press
      <keycap>Control</keycap>-<keycap>Alt</keycap>-<keycap>Del</keycap> 
      to capture the SRM's attention. I have
      never seen this myself, but it is worth trying if you are greeted
      by a blank screen after powerup.</para>

      <para>Make sure you use true 36 bit SIMMs, and only FPM (Fast
      Page Mode) DRAM. EDO DRAM or SIMMs with fake parity <emphasis>will not
      work</emphasis>. The board uses the 4 extra bits for ECC. 33
      bit FPM SIMMs will for the same reason not work.</para>

      <para>Given the choice, get the PS/2-variant mainboard. Apart
      from giving you a mouse port as bonus it is directly supported
      by Tru64 Unix in case you ever want or need to run it. The
      <quote>DIN-plug</quote>-variant should work OK for &os;.</para>

      <para>The <ulink

      <title>Personal Workstation (<quote>Miata</quote>)</title>

      <para>The Miata is a small tower machine intended to be put
      under a desk. There are multiple Miata variants. The original
      Miata is the MX5 model. Because it suffers from a number of
      hardware design flaws a redesign was done, yielding the
      MiataGL. Unfortunately the variants are not easily distinguishable 
      at first sight from the outside of the case.
      An easy check is to see if the back of the machine sports two
      USB connectors. If yes, it is a MiataGL. MX5 models tend to be
      more common in the used system market place.</para>

      <para>System designations look like <quote>Personal Workstation
      433a</quote>. Personal Workstation, being a bit of a mouthful,
      is often abbreviated to PWS.  This means it has a 433 MHz CPU,
      and started life as a WinNT workstation (the trailing
      <quote>a</quote>). Systems designated from day 1 to run Tru64
      Unix or OpenVMS will sport <quote>433au</quote>. WinNT-Miatas
      are likely to come pre-configured with an IDE CDROM drive. So,
      in general systems are named like PWS[433,500,600]a[u].</para>

      <para>There was also a Miata model with a special CPU cooling
      system by Kryotech. The Kryotech has a special cooling system

      <para>The Miata logic is divided into two printed circuit
      boards.  The lower board in the bottom of the machine has the
      PCI and ISA slots and things like the sound chip etc. The top
      board has the CPU, the Pyxis chip, memory etc. Note that MX5
      and the MiataGL use a different PCI riser board. This means
      that you cannot just upgrade to a MiataGL CPU board (with the
      newer Pyxis chip) but that you will also need a different
      riser board. Apparently an MX5 riser with a MiataGL CPU board
      will work but it is definitely not a supported or tested
      configuration.  Everything else (cabinet, wiring, etc.) is
      identical for MX5 and MiataGL.</para>

      <para>MX5 has problems with DMA via the 2 64-bit PCI slots
      when this DMA crosses a page boundary. The 32 bit slots don't
      have this problem because the PCI-PCI bridge chip does not
      allow the offending transfers. The SRM code knows about the
      problem and refuses to start the system if there is a PCI card
      in one of the 64bit slots that it does not know about. Cards
      that are <quote>known good</quote> to the SRM are allowed to
      be used in the 64bit slots.</para>

      <para>If you want to fool the SRM you can type <userinput>set
      pci_device_override</userinput> at the SRM prompt. Just don't
      complain if your data mysteriously gets mangled.</para>

      <para>The complete command is:</para>

      <screen><prompt>&gt;&gt;&gt;</prompt> <userinput>SET PCI_DEVICE_OVERRIDE <replaceable>&lt;vendor_id&gt;</replaceable><replaceable>&lt;device_id&gt;</replaceable></userinput></screen>

      <para>For example:</para>

<screen><prompt>&gt;&gt;&gt;</prompt> <userinput>SET PCI_DEVICE_OVERRIDE 88c15333</userinput></screen>

      <para>The most radical approach is to use:</para>

<screen><prompt>&gt;&gt;&gt;</prompt> <userinput>SET PCI_DEVICE_OVERRIDE -1</userinput></screen>

      <para>This disables PCI ID checking altogether, so that you
      can install any PCI card without its ID getting
      checked. For this to work you need a reasonable current SRM version.</para>

Jan  3 12:22:32 miata /kernel: pcib0: &lt;2117x PCI host bus adapter&gt; on cia0</screen>

      <para>MiataGL does not have the DMA problems of the MX5. PCI
      cards that make the MX5 SRM choke when installed in the 64bit
      slots are accepted without problems by the MiataGL SRM.</para>

      <para>The latest mainboard revisions of MX5 contain a hardware
      workaround for the bug. The SRM does not know about the ECO
      and will complain about unknown cards as before. So does the
      &os; kernel by the way.</para>

      <para>The Miata SRM can boot from IDE CDROM drives. IDE hard disk
      boot is known to work for both MiataGL and MX5 disks, so you
      can root &os; from an IDE disk. Speeds on MX5 are around 14
      Mbytes/sec assuming a suitable drive. Miata's CMD646 chip will
      support up to WDMA2 mode as the chip is too buggy for use
      with UDMA.</para>

      <para>Miata MX5s generally use Qlogic 1040 based SCSI adapters.
      These are bootable by the SRM console. Note that Adaptec cards
      are <emphasis>not</emphasis> bootable by the Miata SRM console.</para>

      <para>The MiataGL has a faster PCI-PCI bridge chip on the PCI
      riser card than some of the MX5 riser card versions. Some of
      the MX5 risers have the <emphasis>same</emphasis> chip as the
      MiataGL. All in all there is a lot of variation.</para>

      <para>Not all VGA cards will work behind the PCI-PCI
      bridge. This manifests itself as no video at all. Workaround
      is to put the VGA card <quote>before</quote> the bridge, in
      one of the 64 bit PCI slots. Graphics performance using a
      64 bit slot is generally substantially better.</para>

      <para>Both MX5 and MiataGL have an on-board sound chip, an
      ESS1888. It emulates a SoundBlaster and can be enabled by
      putting</para>

      <para>in your kernel configuration file:</para>

      <para>in case your Miata has the optional cache board
      installed make sure it is firmly seated. A slightly loose
      cache has been observed to cause weird crashes (not surprising
      obviously, but maybe not so obvious when troubleshooting). The
      cache module is identical between MX5 and MiataGL.</para>

      <para>Installing a 2Mb cache module achieves, apart from a
      10-15% speed increase (based on buildworld elapsed time), a
      <emphasis>decrease</emphasis> for PCI DMA read bandwidth from
      64bit PCI cards. A benchmark on a 64-bit Myrinet card resulted
      in a decrease from 149 Mbytes/sec to 115 Mbytes/sec. Something
      to keep in mind when doing really high speed things with 64
      bit PCI adapters.</para>

      <para>Although the hardware allows you to install up to 1.5Gbyte
      of memory, &os; is limited to 1Gbyte because the DMA code does not
      correctly handle memory above 1Gbyte.</para>

      <para>Moving to a faster CPU is quite simple, swap out the
      CPU chip and set the clock multiplier dipswitch to the speed of
      the new CPU.</para>

      <para>Aspen Alpine is slightly different, but is close enough to the 
      EB64+ to run an EB64+ SRM EPROM (mine did..). The Aspen Alpine does 
      not have an embedded Ethernet, has 3 instead of 2 PCI slots. It comes 
      with 2 Mbytes of cache already soldered onto the mainboard. It has 
      jumpers to select the use of 60, 70 or 80ns SIMM speeds.</para>

      <para>36 bits SIMMs work fine, 3 bits simply remain unused. Note
      the systems use Fast Page Mode memory, not EDO memory.</para>

      <para>The EB64+ SRM console code is housed in an UV-erasable EPROM. No 
      easy flash SRM upgrades for the EB64+ The latest SRM version available 
      for EB64+ is quite ancient anyway.</para>

      <para>The EB64+ SRM can boot both 53C810 and Qlogic1040 SCSI adapters. 
      Pitfall for the Qlogic is that the firmware that is down-loaded by 
      the SRM onto the Qlogic chip is very old. There are no updates for the 
      EB64+ SRM available. So you are stuck with old Qlogic bits too. 
      I have had quite some problems when I wanted to use Ultra-SCSI drives 
      on the Alpine with Qlogic. The &os; kernel can be compiled to include 
      a much newer Qlogic firmware revision. This is not the default because 
      it adds hundreds of kBytes worth of bloat to the kernel. In &os; 4.1 
      and later the isp firmware is contained in a kernel loadable module. 
      All of this might mean that you need to use a non-Qlogic adapter to 
      boot from.</para>

      <para>AlphaPC64 boards generally come with ARC console firmware. 
      SRM console code can be loaded from floppy into the Flash ROM.</para>

      <para>The IDE interface of the AlphaPC64 is not bootable from the 
      SRM console. Enabling it requires the following line in the kernel
      configuration file:</para>
 
      <programlisting>device ata</programlisting>

      <para>The ATA interface uses irq 14.</para>

      <para>Note that the boards require a power supply that supplies
      3.3 Volts for the CPU.</para>

      <para>For the EB64 family machines the kernel config file must contain:</para>

      <para>Using 8 SIMMs for a 256bit wide memory can yield interesting
      speedups over a 4 SIMM/128bit wide memory. Obviously all 8 SIMMs must
      be of the same type to make this work. The system must be explicitly
      setup to use the 8 SIMM memory arrangement. You must have 8 SIMMs,
      4 SIMMs distributed over 2 banks will not work. For the AlphaPC164
      you can have a maximum of 1Gbyte of RAM, using 8 128Mbyte 
      SIMMs. The manual indicates the maximum is 512 Mbyte.</para>

      <para>The SRM can boot from Qlogic 10xx boards or the Symbios 53C810[A].
      Newer Symbios 810 revisions like the Symbios 810AE are not recognized by
      the SRM on PC164. PC164 SRM does not appear to recognize a Symbios 53C895 
      based host adapter (tested with a Tekram DC-390U2W). On the other hand 
      some no-name Symbios 53C985 board has been reported to work.
      Cards like the Tekram DC-390F (Symbios875 based) have been confirmed to 
      work fine on the PC164.  Symbios 53C896 has been confirmed to not 
      work.</para>

      <para>Symbios 53C825[a] will also work as boot adapter. Diamond 
      FirePort, although based on Symbios chips, is not bootable by the 
      PC164SX SRM. PC164SX is reported to boot fine with Symbios825, 
      Symbios875, Symbios895 and Symbios876 based cards. In addition, Adaptec 
      2940U and 2940UW are reported to work for booting (verified on 
      SRM V5.7-1). Adaptec 2930U2 and 2940U2[W] do not work.</para>

      <para>164LX and 164SX with SRM firmware version 5.8 or later can boot 
      from Adaptec 2940-series adapters. A test with an Adaptec 3940UW
      showed that that one is not supported however. 164SX SRM recognises
      Intel 8255x Ethernet cards which show up as eia. Using such a 
      NIC allows network booting.</para>

      <para>In summary: this family of machines is <quote>blessed</quote> with 
      a challenging compatibility as far as SCSI adapters go.</para>

      <para>On 164SX you can have a maximum of 1 Gbyte of RAM. 4 regular
      (PC100 or PC133) 256MB DIMMs are reported to work just fine. Whether 
      512MB DIMMs will also work is currently unknown. You can use ECC or
      non-ECC DIMMs. The non-ECC ones are the same as commonly found in PCs.
      Unfortunately the 164SX is quite picky on which DIMMs it likes,
      so be prepared to test and experiment.
      </para>

      <para>PCI bridge chips are sometimes not appreciated by the 164SX, 
      they cause SRM errors and kernel panics in those cases. This seems
      to depend on the fact if the card is recognised, and therefore
      correctly initialised, by the SRM console. The 164SX' onboard 
      IDE interface is quite slow, a Promise card gives a 3-4 times 
      speed improvement.</para>

      <para>On PC164 the SRM sometimes seems to lose its variable settings.
      <quote>For PC164, current superstition says that, to avoid losing settings,
      you want to first downgrade to SRM 4.x and then upgrade to 5.x.</quote>
      One sample error that was observed was:</para>
      <screen>ERROR: ISA table corrupt!</screen>

      <para>A sequence of a downgrade to SRM4.9, an</para>

 <screen><prompt>&gt;&gt;&gt;</prompt> <userinput>ISACFG -INIT</userinput></screen>

      <para>made the problem go away. Some PC164 owners report they have never seen 
      the problem. </para>

      <para>On PC164SX the AlphaBIOS allows you a selection to select SRM to
      be used as console on the next power up. This selection does 
      not appear to have any effect. In other words, you will get the 
      AlphaBIOS regardless of what you select. The fix is to reflash the 
      console ROM with the SRM code for PC164SX. This will overwrite the 
      AlphaBIOS and will get you the SRM console you desire. The SRM code 
      can be found on the Compaq Web site.</para>

      <para>164LX can either have the SRM console code or the AlphaBIOS
      code in its flash ROM because the flash ROM is too small to hold
      both at the same time.</para>

      <para>PC164 can boot from IDE disks assuming your SRM version is 
      recent enough.</para>

      <para>EB164 needs a power supply that supplies 3.3 Volts. PC164 does 
      not implement the PS_ON signal that ATX power supplies need to switch on. 
      A simple switch pulling this signal to ground allows you to run a
      standard ATX power supply.</para>

      <para>Early machines had Fast SCSI interfaces, later ones are Ultra 
      SCSI capable. AS500 shares its single SCSI bus with internal and external 
      devices. For a Fast SCSI bus you are limited to 1.8 meters bus 
      length external to the box. The AS500 Qlogic ISP1020A chip can be set
      to run in Ultra mode by setting a SRM variable. &os; however follows
      the Qlogic chip errata and limits the bus speed to Fast.</para>

      <para>Beware of ancient SRM versions on AS500. When you see weird

      <para>AS600 has one Qlogic SCSI chip dedicated to the internal devices 
      whereas the other Qlogic SCSI chip is dedicated to external SCSI devices.
      Keep the card, which apart from the two SCSI interfaces also houses 
      the Ethernet chip by the way in the DEC-recommended, topmost, 32bit 
      PCI slot. You get machine checks if you plug it into one of the 64 bit
      slots.</para>
  
      <para>In AS500 DIMMs are installed in sets of 4, in <quote>physically

      4 physically adjacent DIMMs. Note that the DIMMs are <emphasis>not</emphasis>
      SDRAM DIMMs.</para>
  
      <para>In AS600 the memory SIMMs are placed onto two memory daughter 
      cards. SIMMs are installed in sets of 8. Both memory daughter cards must 
      be populated identically.</para>
  
      <para>Note that both AS500 and AS600 are EISA machines. This means
      you have to run the EISA Configuration Utility (ECU) from floppy
      after adding EISA cards or to change things like the configuration
      settings of the onboard I/O. For AS500 which does not have a physical
      EISA slot the ECU is used to configure the onboard sound interface
      etc.</para>

      <para>AS500 onboard sound can be used by adding a line like</para>

      <programlisting>device pcm</programlisting> 

      <para>to the kernel configuration file.</para>

      <para>Using the ECU I configured my AS500 to use IRQ 10, port 0x530,
      drq 0. Corresponding entries along with flags 0x10011 must go into
      the <filename>device.hints</filename> file. Note that the flags value is rather non-standard.
      </para>

      <para>AS600 has a peculiarity for its PCI slots. AS600 (or rather the 
      PCI expansion card containing the SCSI adapters) does not allow I/O port 
      mapping, therefore all devices behind it must use memory mapping. If you 
      have problems getting the Qlogic SCSI adapters to work, add the following 
      option to <filename>/boot/loader.rc</filename>:</para>
  
      <programlisting>set isp_mem_map=0xff</programlisting>

      <para>The AlphaServer 1000 and 800 range of machines are intended as 
      departmental servers. They come in quite some variations in packaging 
      and mainboard/cpu. Generally speaking there are 21064 (EV4) CPU based 
      machines and 21164 (EV5) based ones. The CPU is on a daughter card, and 
      the type of CPU (EV4 or EV5) must match the mainboard in use.</para>

      <para>AlphaServer 800 has a much smaller mini tower case, it lacks the 
      StorageWorks SCSI hot-plug chassis. The main difference between AS1000 
      and AS1000A is that AS1000A has 7 PCI slots whereas AS1000 only has 3 
      PCI slots and has EISA slots instead.</para>

      All EV5 based machines use standard PS/2 style 36 bit 72pin SIMMs in sets

      (4 bits out of 36). The EV5 mainboards have 16 SIMM slots, 
      the EV4 mainboards have 20 slots.</para>

      <para> AS800 machines use DIMMs in sets of 4. DIMM installation must

      <para>The system has a smart power controller. This means that parts 
      of the system remain powered when it is switched off (like an ATX-style 
      PC power supply). Before servicing the machine remove the 
      power cord.</para>

      <para>The smart power controller is called the RMC. When enabled, 
      typing <keycap>Escape</keycap><keycap>Escape</keycap>RMC on serial port 1
      will bring you to the RMC prompt. RMC allows you to powerup or powerdown,
      reset the machine, monitor and set temperature trip levels etc. RMC
      has its own builtin help.</para>

      <para>Webbrick is shipped in a desktop-style case similar to the older 
      21164 <quote>Maverick</quote> workstations but this case 
      offers much better access 
      to the components. If you intend to build a farm you can rackmount them 
      in a 19-inch rack; they are 3U high. Slate is 1U high but has only 
      one PCI slot.</para>

      <para>DS10 has 4 DIMM slots. DIMMs are installed as pairs. Please note 
      that DIMM pairs are not installed in adjacent DIMM sockets but rather 
      physically interleaved. DIMM sizes of 32, 64, 128, 256 and 512 Mbytes 
      are supported.</para>

      <para>When 2 pairs of identical-sized DIMMs are installed DS10 will 
      use memory interleaving for increased performance. DS10L, which has 
      only 2 DIMM slots cannot do interleaving.</para>

      <para>Starting with SRM firmware version 5.9 you can boot from 
      Adaptec 2940-series adapters in addition to the usual set of Qlogic 
      and Symbios/NCR adapters. KZPEA aka Adaptec 39160 gives you dual
      channel LVD U160 SCSI which is bootable from SRM.</para>

      <para>The base model comes with a FUJITSU 9.5GB ATA disk as its boot 
      device. &os; works just fine using EIDE disks on Webbrick. DS10 has 
      2 IDE interfaces on the mainboard. Machines destined for Tru64 Unix or 
      VMS are standard equipped with Qlogic-driven Ultra-SCSI disks</para>

      <para>On the PCI bus 32 and 64 bit cards are supported, in 3.3V and 
      5V variants.</para>

      for other modules (IO and memory) as well, but it has not been verified.
      </para>

      <para>The machines use dedicated memory boards. These boards live on 
      a 128 bit C-bus shared with the CPU boards. DemiSable supports up 
      to 1GB, Sable up to 2GB. One of the memory bus slots can either 
      hold a CPU or a memory card. A 4 CPU machine can have a maximum of 
      2 memory boards.</para>

      <para>Some memory board models house SIMMs. These are called SIMM 
      carriers. There are also memory modules that have soldered-on memory 
      chips instead of SIMMs. These are called <quote>flat memory 
      modules</quote>.</para>

      <para>SIMM boards are used in sets of eight 72-pin 36 bit FPM 
      memory of 70ns or faster. SIMM types supported are 1M x36 bit 
      (4 Mbyte), 2M x36bit (8 Mbyte) and 4M x36 bit (16 Mbyte). 
      Each memory board can house 
      4 banks of SIMMs. SIMM sizes can not be mixed on a single memory 
      board. The first memory module must be filled with SIMMs before 
      starting to fill the next memory module. Note that the spacing

      <para>AS2100[A] come equipped with a StorageWorks 7 slot SCSI 
      cage. A second cage can be added inside the cabinet. AS2000 
      has a single 7 slot SCSI cage, which cannot be expanded with 
      an additional one. Note that the slot locations in these cages 
      map differently to SCSI IDs compared to the standard StorageWorks 
      shelves. Slot IDs from top to bottom are 0, 4, 1, 5, 2, 6, 3 
      when using a single bus configuration.</para>

      <para>The cage can also be set to provide two independent SCSI 
      buses. This is used for embedded RAID controllers like the 
      KZPSC (Mylex DAC960). Slot ID assignments for split bus are, 
      from top to bottom: 0A, 0B, 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, 3A, 3B. 
      Where A and B signify a SCSI bus. In a single bus configuration the 
      terminator module on the back of the SCSI cage is on the TOP. The jumper
      module is on the BOTTOM. For split bus operation these two modules are
      reversed. The terminator can be distinguished from the jumper 
      by noting the chips on the terminator. The jumper does not have 
      any active components on it.</para>

      <para>DemiSable has 7 EISA slots and 3 PCI slots. Sable has 
      8 EISA and 3 PCI slots. Lynx, being newer, has 8 PCI 
      and 3 EISA slots. The Lynx PCI slots are grouped in 
      sets of 4. The 4 PCI slots closest to the CPU/memory
      slots are the primary slots, so logically before the PCI bridge chip.
      Note that contrary to expectation the primary PCI slots are the highest
      numbered ones (PCI4 - PCI7).</para>

      up to 4 CPUs can be in a single machine.  Basic disk storage is housed in 
      one or two StorageWorks shelves at the bottom of the pedestal. The

     <para>Rawhide can be equipped with a variety of CPU modules. CPU
     modules exist in versions with and without external cache. In all
     cases the CPU modules installed always must be of the same speed. A mix
     of NT-only and full-blown Tru64/VMS CPUs works fine. It will however
     result in the system reporting itself to the operating system 
     as a Digital Server 730x (so the NT-only variant). &os; does not care,
     but such a system will not allow Tru64 or VMS to run.</para>

     <para>Rawhide uses a maximum of 8 RAM modules. These modules are used 
     in pairs and supply 72 bits to the bus (this includes ECC bits). 
     Memory can be EDO RAM or synchronous DRAM. A fully populated AS4100 
     has 4 pairs of memory modules. The AS4000 model is limited to 2 pairs
     of memory modules. Given the choice use SDRAM for 
     best performance. The highest capacity memory boards must be in the
     memory slots marked MEM0L and MEM0H. A mix of memory board 
     sizes is allowed. A mix of EDO and SDRAM works as well (assuming you don't 
     try to mix EDO and SDRAM in a single module pair). A mix of EDO and SDRAM
     results in the <emphasis>entire</emphasis> memory subsystem running at
     the slower EDO timing.</para>

     <para>Rawhide has an embedded Symbios 810 chip that gives you a
     narrow fast-SCSI bus. Generally only the SCSI CDROM is driven by
     this interface.</para>

     <para>Rawhides are available with a 8 64-bit PCI / 3 EISA 
     slot expansion backplanes (called <quote>Saddle</quote> modules). There 
     are 2 separate PCI buses, PCI0 and PCI1. PCI0 has 1 dedicated 
     PCI slot and (shared) 3 PCI/EISA slots. PCI0 also has a
     PCI/EISA bridge that drives things like the serial and 
     parallel ports, keyboard/mouse etc. PCI1 has 4 PCI slots 
     and a Symbios 810 SCSI chip. VGA console cards must be installed 
     in a slot connected to PCI0.</para>

     <para>The current &os; implementation has problems in handling 
     PCI bridges. There is currently a limited fix in place which allows 
     for single level, single device PCI bridges. The fix allows the use of
     the Digital supplied Qlogic SCSI card which sits behind 
     a 21054 PCI bridge chip.</para>

     <note><para>EISA slots are currently unsupported, but the Compaq Qvision
     EISA VGA adapter is treated as an ISA device. It therefore works 
     as a console. In case you use EISA options in your machine you
     must run the EISA Configuration Utility (ECU) from floppy. Do yourself
     a favor and use the Tru64/OpenVMS ECU, and not the WindowsNT ECU.
     </para></note>

     <para>Rawhide employs an I2C based power controller system. If 
     you want to be sure all power is removed from the system remove all
     mains cables from the system.</para>

     <para>Rawhide comes with RCM functionality, which means you can 
     power it on/off remotely, reset it etc. See also the description for
     the RMC in the DS10 section of this document. RCM versus RMC is not a typo,
     the various documentation I consulted used both acronyms
     interchangeably. Note that if you want remote power on/off to function
     you need to connect a small DC adapter to the machine in order to have
     the RCM logic powered. You need to supply 9-12V DC to the small inlet 
     located next to the keyboard connector.</para>

      DIMMs smaller than 256 Mbyte are used the system's physical memory 
      map will contain <quote>holes</quote>. Supported DIMM sizes are 64 Mbytes

      PCI/EISA bridge that drives things like the serial and parallel ports,

      <para>SRM console code comes standard with the ES40.</para>
      
      <para>ES40 comes with an ATA CDROM drive, but uses SCSI
      harddisks. The usual Symbios & Qlogic adapters are bootable,
      as is the KZPEA aka Adaptec 39160 dual channel LVD U160 adapter.</para>

      <para>Memory is divided in 4 memory arrays which each contain 
      a set of 4 SDRAM DIMMs. Each DIMM is 72 bit wide and of the 100MHz
      speed variant. An array can contain 2 sets, so 8 DIMMs max per array.
      The DIMMs live on Memory Mother Boards (MMBs). There are 2 MMB models,
      with 4 and 8 DIMM sockets respectively. Each MMB provides half of the
      256 bit memory bus width to the CPUs. 
      Given the myriad options for the memory configuration it is advisable 
      to check the system documentation for the optimum memory 
      configuration.</para>

      <para>Dependent on the model variation the ES40 has 6 or 10 64 bit PCI
      slots. This is basically just means the same backplane with less 
      connectors mounted.</para>

      <para>ES40 has the same RMC remote power control as DS10 and DS20. 
      See the description of the RMC in the DS10 section of this document.
      Most variations of ES40 have multiple power supplies, allowing
      for N+1 redundancy. When installing CPU cards you must unplug all
      power cords, the CPU cards receive standby power from the power
      supplies. Maximum memory configurations need more than the default
      number of powersupplies.</para>
      
      <para>The kernel config file must contain:</para>
      <programlisting>options   DEC_ST6600
cpu     EV5</programlisting>

      <para>Contrary to expectation there is no <literal>cpu
      EV6</literal> defined for inclusion in the kernel config 
      file. The <literal>cpu EV5</literal> is mandatory to keep

    <title>Supported Hardware Overview</title>

    <para>A word of caution: the installed base for &os; is not
    nearly as large as for &os;/Intel. This means that the enormous
    variation of PCI/ISA expansion cards out there has much less
    chance of having been tested on alpha than on Intel. This is not
    to imply they are doomed to fail, just that the chance of running
    into something never tested before is much higher.
    <filename>GENERIC</filename>
    contains things that are known to work on Alpha only.</para>

    <para>The PCI and ISA expansion busses are fully supported. Turbo
    Channel is not in <filename>GENERIC</filename> and has limited
    support (see the relevant machine model info).  The MCA bus is not
    supported. The EISA bus is not supported for use with EISA
    expansion cards as the EISA support code is lacking. ISA cards in
    EISA slots are reported to work. The Compaq Qvision EISA VGA card
    is driven in ISA mode and works OK as a console.</para>

    <para>1.44 Mbyte and 1.2 Mbyte floppy drives are supported.
    2.88 Mbyte drives sometimes found in Alpha machines are supported up to
    1.44Mbyte.</para>

    <para>ATA and ATAPI (IDE) devices are supported via the &man.ata.4;
    driver framework. As most people run their Alphas with SCSI disks
    it is not as well tested as SCSI. Be aware of boot-ability
    restrictions for IDE disks. See the machine specific information.</para>

    <para>There is full SCSI support via the CAM layer for Adaptec
    2940x (AIC7xxx chip-based), Qlogic family and Symbios. Those of 
    you interested in U160 SCSI might want to take a look at an Adaptec
    39160 dual channel LVD U160 adapter. Compaq calls this a KZPEA adapter.
    Recent Alpha models have SRM versions that can boot from them. In general
    be aware of the machine-specific boot-ability issues for the 
    various adapter models. Where known they are listed in the
    individual machine descriptions.</para>

    <para>The Qlogic QL2x00 FibreChannel host adapters are fully
    supported.</para>

    <para>If you want to boot your Alpha over the Ethernet you will
    obviously need an Ethernet card that the SRM console
    recognizes. This generally means you need a board with an 21x4x
    Ethernet chip as that is what Digital used. These chips are driven
    by the &os; &man.de.4; (older driver) or &man.dc.4; (newer
    driver). Some new SRM versions are known to recognize the Intel
    8255x Ethernet chips as driven by the &os; &man.fxp.4; driver. But
    beware: the &man.fxp.4; driver is reported not to work correctly
    with &os;/alpha (although it works excellently on &os;/x86).</para>

    <para>In general the SRM console emulates a VGA-compatibility mode
    on PCI VGA cards. This is, however, not guaranteed to work by
    Compaq/DEC for each and every card type out there. When the SRM
    thinks the VGA is acceptable &os; will be able to use it. The
    console driver works just like on a &os;/intel machine. 
    Please note that VESA modes are not supported on Alpha,
    so that leaves you with 80x25 consoles.</para>

    <para>In some Alpha machines you will find video adapters based
    on TGA chips.  TGA support in &os; is not as robust as it should
    be.  In case of problems it is advisable to try either a 
    serial console or a plain VGA card.</para>

    <para>The <quote>PC standard</quote> serial ports found on most
    Alphas are supported.</para>

    <para>ISDN (i4b) is not supported on &os;/alpha.</para>

    <para>In compiling this file I used multiple information sources,
    but <ulink url="http://www.netbsd.org/">the NetBSD Web
    site</ulink> proved to be an invaluable source of information.  If
    it wasn't for NetBSD/alpha there probably would not be a
    &os;/alpha in the first place.</para>
