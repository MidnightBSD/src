    <para>This article gives some brief instructions on installing

    <title>Installing &os;</title>

    <para>The <uri

	  &os;</uri>
      chapter of the <uri
	xlink:href="&url.books.handbook;/">&os;
	Handbook</uri> provides more in-depth information about the
      installation program itself, including a guided walk-through with
      screenshots.</para>

  <sect1 xml:id="upgrade">
    <title>Upgrading &os;</title>

    <para>If you are upgrading from a previous release of &os;, please
      read <uri
      xlink:href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/10.0R/relnotes.html#upgrade">upgrading
      section in the Release Notes</uri> for notable
      incompatibilities carefully.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Upgrading from Source</title>

      <para>The procedure for doing a source code based update is
	described in
	<uri xlink:href="&url.books.handbook;/synching.html"></uri> and
	<uri xlink:href="&url.books.handbook;/makeworld.html"></uri>.</para>

      <para>For SVN use the <filename>releng/10.0</filename> branch
	which will be where any upcoming Security Advisories or Errata
	Notices will be applied.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Upgrading Using <quote>&os; Update</quote></title>

      <para>The &man.freebsd-update.8; utility supports binary
	upgrades of &arch.i386; and &arch.amd64; systems running
	earlier FreeBSD releases. Systems running
	<literal>7.[34]-RELEASE</literal>,
	<literal>8.[1234]-RELEASE</literal>,
	<literal>9.[012]-RELEASE</literal>,
	<literal>10.0-RC[123]</literal> can upgrade as follows:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; freebsd-update fetch
&prompt.root; freebsd-update install</screen>

      <para>Now the &man.freebsd-update.8; utility can fetch bits
	belonging to &release.current;.  During this process
	&man.freebsd-update.8; will ask for help in merging
	configuration files.</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; freebsd-update upgrade -r 10.0-RELEASE</screen>

      <para>Due to changes in the way that &os; is packaged on the
	release media, two complications may arise in this process if
	upgrading from FreeBSD 8.x or 9.x:</para>

      <orderedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>The &os;, which previously could appear in either
	    <filename>/boot/kernel</filename> or
	    <filename>/boot/GENERIC</filename>, now only appears as
	    <filename>/boot/kernel</filename>.  As a result, any
	    kernel appearing in <filename>/boot/GENERIC</filename>
	    will be deleted.  Please carefully read the output printed
	    by &man.freebsd-update.8; and confirm that an updated
	    kernel will be placed into
	    <filename>/boot/kernel</filename> before proceeding beyond
	    this point.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>The &os; source tree in <filename>/usr/src</filename>
	    (if present) will be deleted.  (Normally the
	    &man.freebsd-update.8; utility will update a source tree,
	    but in this case the changes in release packaging result
	    in the &man.freebsd-update.8; utility not recognizing that
	    the source tree from the old release and the source tree
	    from the new release correspond to the same part of
	    &os;.)</para>
	</listitem>
      </orderedlist>

      <screen>&prompt.root; freebsd-update install</screen>

      <para>The system must now be rebooted with the newly installed
	kernel before the non-kernel components are updated.</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; shutdown -r now</screen>

      <para>After rebooting, &man.freebsd-update.8; needs to be run
	again to install the new userland components:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; freebsd-update install</screen>

      <para>At this point, users of systems being upgraded from &os;
	9.2-RELEASE or earlier will be prompted by
	&man.freebsd-update.8; to rebuild all third-party applications
	(e.g., ports installed from the ports tree) due to updates in
	system libraries.</para>

      <para>After updating installed third-party applications (and
	again, only if &man.freebsd-update.8; printed a message
	indicating that this was necessary), run
	&man.freebsd-update.8; again so that it can delete the old (no
	longer used) system libraries:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; freebsd-update install</screen>

      <para>Finally, reboot into &release.current;</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; shutdown -r now</screen>
