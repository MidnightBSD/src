      <para>This document lists errata items for &os; &release;,
	containing significant information discovered after the
	release or too late in the release cycle to be otherwise
	included in the release documentation.  This information
	includes security advisories, as well as news relating to the
	software or documentation that could affect its operation or
	usability.  An up-to-date version of this document should
	always be consulted before installing this version of
	&os;.</para>

      <para>This errata document for &os; &release; will be maintained
	until the release of &os; &release.next; (if
	applicable).</para>

    <para>This errata document contains <quote>late-breaking
	news</quote> about &os; &release;.  Before installing this
      version, it is important to consult this document to learn about
      any post-release discoveries or problems that may already have
      been found and fixed.</para>

    <para>Any version of this errata document actually distributed
      with the release (for example, on a CDROM distribution) will be
      out of date by definition, but other copies are kept updated on
      the Internet and should be consulted as the <quote>current
	errata</quote> for this release.  These other copies of the
      errata are located at <link
	xlink:href="https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/" />, plus any
      sites which keep up-to-date mirrors of this location.</para>

    <para>Source and binary snapshots of &os; &release.branch; also
      contain up-to-date copies of this document (as of the time of
      the snapshot).</para>
