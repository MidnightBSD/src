    <para>(2005/11/26)
      On 6.0-RELEASE, the following &man.ipfw.4; rule is interpreted
      in a different way from the previous releases:</para>

    <programlisting>allow ipv6 from 192.168.0.2 to me</programlisting>

    <para>When &man.ipfw.4; does not support IPv6 (see the next
      entry for the details), &man.ipfw.8; accepts this rule and
      this blocks an IPv6 packet encapsulated in an IPv4 packet
      (IPv6-over-IPv4 tunneling, protocol number 41) whose
      source address is <literal>192.168.0.2</literal>.
      When it supports IPv6, on the other hand, this means a rule
      to allow an IPv6 packet from <literal>192.168.0.2</literal>,
      and actually &man.ipfw.8; rejects this rule because the
      syntax is incorrect (<quote>an IPv6 packet from an IPv4 address</quote>
      never happens).  Unfortunately there is no simple workaround
      for this problem.</para>

    <para>The &man.ipfw.4; IPv6 support still has rough edges
      and there are other problems due to incompatibility between
      the two.  As a workaround for them, you can use a combination
      of IPv4-only &man.ipfw.4; and &man.ip6fw.8;, which is almost
      compatible with the prior releases, instead of &man.ipfw.4;
      with IPv6 support.
      To disable IPv6 support of &man.ipfw.4;, use
      the <filename>ipfw.ko</filename> kernel module and
      do not use the kernel option <literal>IPFIREWALL</literal>.</para>

    <para>(2005/11/19)
      Although the &os; 6.0-RELEASE Release Notes states that
      &man.ipfw.4; subsystem now supports IPv6,
      the combination of the <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel
      and a kernel module <filename>ipfw.ko</filename>
      does not support the <literal>ip6</literal> protocol keyword
      for packet filtering rule.  This is because the kernel option
      <literal>INET6</literal> in the kernel configuration file
      is not recognized when the <filename>ipfw.ko</filename>
      is built.  To enable IPv6 support of &man.ipfw.4;, rebuild
      the kernel with kernel options <literal>INET6</literal>
      and <literal>IPFIREWALL</literal> instead of
      using the <filename>ipfw.ko</filename> module.</para>

    <para>(2005/11/16)
      Using &man.if.bridge.4; in combination with a packet filter
      such as &man.ipfw.4; and &man.pf.4; can prevent the network
      stack from working and/or lead to a system panic after
      a certain period of time.
      This is because it allocates &man.mbuf.9; buffers for network
      packets and never releases a part of them, so eventually
      all of the buffer memory will be exhausted.
      This problem has been fixed in the HEAD and the RELENG_6
      branch after 10:17:15 2005/11/16 UTC.</para>

    <para>(2005/11/16, updated on 2005/11/19)
      When an &man.ipfw.4; <literal>divert</literal> rule
      is specified with the protocol keyword <literal>ip</literal>
      or <literal>all</literal>,
      IPv6 packets are silently discarded at that rule
      since the &man.divert.4; socket does not support IPv6.
      This can be a problem especially for an IPv4 and IPv6 dual-stack host
      with &man.natd.8; enabled.  <emphasis role="bold">Note that
	the kernel module <filename>ipfw.ko</filename> does not
	have this problem because it does not support IPv6.</emphasis>
      To avoid this problem, use an IPv4 specific divert rule such
      as <literal>divert natd ipv4</literal>
      instead of <literal>divert natd all</literal>.</para>

    <para>(2005/11/6)
      The &os; 6.0-RELEASE Release Notes wrongly states
      a kernel option related to &man.ipfw.8; as
      <literal>IPFIRWALL_FORWARD</literal>.
      The correct option keyword is <literal>IPFIREWALL_FORWARD</literal>.</para>

    <para>(2005/11/5)
      The &os; 6.0-RELEASE Release Notes wrongly states the version number
      of OpenSSH and IPFilter integrated into &os; as 4.1p1 and 4.1.18.
      The correct versions are 4.2p1 and 4.1.8 respectively.</para>

    <para>(2005/11/5)
      Distribution of 6.0-RELEASE contains <filename>CHECKSUM.MD5</filename>
      and <filename>CHECKSUM.SHA256</filename> files for protecting
      the integrity of data.  However, these files in 6.0-RELEASE erroneously
      include checksums for the checksum files themselves.
      Although the checksums look like wrong, they can be safely ignored
      because a checksum for the checksum file never corresponds
      to one in the file.  This problem will be fixed in the next
      releases.</para>

    <para>(2005/11/5, &os;/amd64 specific)
      The &man.pmcstat.8; utility cannot yet handle 32-bit
      executables when converting &man.hwpmc.4; log
      files to &man.gprof.1; format.</para>

    <para>(2005/11/5, &os;/powerpc specific)
      The following panic may occur at boot-time on some older
      PowerMac G4 systems:</para>

<screen>...
KDB: current backend: ddb
panic: Assertion curthread != NULL failed at
/usr/src/sys/kern/kern_mutex.c:268
KDB: enter panic</screen>

    <para>This is a known problem with no workaround, and will be fixed in the
      next release.</para>

    <para>(2005/11/5)
      Changes of on-disk format of <filename>/usr/share/locale/*/LC_*</filename>
      files in 6.0-RELEASE prevent third-party software which uses
      &man.setlocale.3; for its localization from working after
      a 5.x system upgraded.  The software includes ones installed
      into the 5.x system by using &os; Ports Collection and so on.
      To solve this problem, perform one of the following:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>Install misc/compat5x package into the upgraded 6.0 system.
	  This package installs a library <filename>lib/compat/libc.so.5</filename>
	  which makes the software complied in a 5.x system use
	  the old locale files to keep compatibility.
	  Note that you need to remove <filename>/lib/libc.so.5</filename>
	  after upgrading.</para>

	<para>This package is available only for Tier-1 platforms.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Recompile the software on the 6.0 system.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>(2005/10/3)
      At boot time the &os;/sparc64 GENERIC kernel may
      output the following messages when the machine has
      no framebuffer:</para>

    <screen>Aug 26 19:31:27 hostname getty[429]: open /dev/ttyv1: No such file or directory</screen>

    <para>This is because the machine with no supported
      graphics hardware does not recognize &man.syscons.4; and
      <filename>/dev/ttyv*</filename> device nodes are not created.
      This is not a harmful error and can be suppressed by disabling
      <filename>/dev/ttyv*</filename> entries in
      <filename>/etc/ttys</filename>.</para>

    <para>(2005/10/3)
      Kernel modules do not work on &os;/sparc64
      when the machine has more than 4GB memory.  There is no workaround
      for this issue except for compiling the modules statically into
      your custom kernel in advance.</para>

    <para>(2005/10/3)
      The &man.kgdb.1; utility does not work properly
      on &os;/sparc64 for debugging panics which include traps.
      As a workaround you can use <filename>devel/gdb53</filename>.</para>
