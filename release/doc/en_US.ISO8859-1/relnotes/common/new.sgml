  <title>What's New</title>

  <para>This section describes
    the most user-visible new or changed features in &os;
    since &release.prev;.</para>

  <para>Typical release note items
    document recent security advisories issued after
    &release.prev;,
    new drivers or hardware support, new commands or options,
    major bug fixes, or contributed software upgrades.  They may also
    list changes to major ports/packages or release engineering
    practices.  Clearly the release notes cannot list every single
    change made to &os; between releases; this document focuses
    primarily on security advisories, user-visible changes, and major
    architectural improvements.</para>

  <sect2 id="kernel">
    <title>Kernel Changes</title>

    <para>The &man.ddb.4; debugger now supports the <literal>show lock</literal>
      command.  If the argument has a valid lock class,
      this displays various information about the lock and calls a
      new function pointer in lock_class (lc_ddb_show) to dump class-specific
      information about the lock as well (such as the owner of a mutex or
      xlock'ed sx lock).</para>

    <para><filename>DEFAULTS</filename> kernel configuration files
      for each platform have been added.</para>

    <para>The &man.firmware.9; subsystem has been added.  This allows
      to load binary data into the kernel via a specially crafted module.</para>

    <para>The &man.random.4; entropy device driver is now MPSAFE.</para>

    <para>A new sysctl variable <varname>security.mac.biba.interfaces_equal</varname>
      which makes all network interfaces be created with the label
      <literal>biba/equal(equal-equal)</literal>, has been added.
      This is useful where programs such as &man.dhclient.8; and &man.ppp.8;.
      which initialize network interfaces do not have any labeling support.
      This variable is set as <literal>0</literal>(disabled) by default.</para>

    <!-- Above this line, sort kernel changes by manpage/keyword-->

    <sect3 id="boot">
      <title>Boot Loader Changes</title>

      <para arch="i386,amd64">A new loader tunable
	<varname>comconsole_speed</varname> to change
	the serial console speed has been added.
	If the previous stage boot loader requested a serial console
	then the default speed is determined from the current serial port
	speed, and otherwise it is set to 9600 or the value of
	the kernel option <literal>BOOT_COMCONSOLE_SPEED</literal>
	at compile time.</para>

      <!-- Above this line, order boot loader changes by keyword-->

    </sect3>

    <sect3 id="proc">
      <title>Hardware Support</title>

      <para>The &man.acpi.thermal.4; driver now supports
	passive cooling.</para>

      <para arch="i386,pc98">The &man.ce.4; driver, which supports
	Cronyx Tau-PCI/32 adapters, has been added.</para>

      <para>The &man.kbdmux.4; driver has been integrated into &man.syscons.4; and
	the <devicename>kbd</devicename> device driver.
	By default &man.syscons.4; will look for the &man.kbdmux.4;
	keyboard first, and then, if not found, look for any keyboard.
	Switching to &man.kbdmux.4; can be done at boot time by loading
	the <literal>kbdmux</literal> kernel module via &man.loader.8;,
	or at runtime via &man.kldload.8; and releasing the active
	keyboard.</para>

      <para arch="i386">The &man.kbdmux.4; driver has been included in the
	<filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel by default.
	Also, the <quote>Boot FreeBSD with USB keyboard</quote>
	menu item in the boot loader menu has been removed
	since this fixes USB keyboard probing problems.
	</para>

      <sect4 id="mm">
	<title>Multimedia Support</title>

	<para>The &man.agp.4; driver now supports ATI IGP chipsets.</para>

	<para>The &man.sound.4; driver has been updated in
	  various aspects including fixing lock-related bugs
	  that could cause system panics in the previous releases
	  and some performance improvements.
	  Also this driver now supports
	  wider range sampling rate, multiple precisions choice,
	  and 24/32-bit PCM format conversion.</para>

	<para>The &man.snd.atiixp.4; driver has been added.
	  This supports ATI IXP 200/300/400 series audio controllers.</para>

	<para>The &man.snd.als4000.4; driver is now MPSAFE.</para>

	<para>The &man.snd.es137x.4; driver is now MPSAFE.</para>

	<para>The &man.snd.ich.4; driver is now MPSAFE.</para>

	<para>The &man.snd.solo.4; driver is now MPSAFE.</para>

	<para arch="amd64">The &man.speaker.4; driver now supports &os;/amd64.</para>

	<para>The &man.snd.via8233.4; driver is now MPSAFE.</para>

	<para>The &man.snd.via82c686.4; driver is now MPSAFE.</para>

      </sect4>

      <sect4 id="net-if">
	<title>Network Interface Support</title>

	<para>The &man.ath.4; driver has been updated to
	  version 0.9.16.16.</para>

	<para arch="i386,amd64">The &man.bce.4; driver, which supports Broadcom
	  NetXtreme II (BCM5706/BCM5708) PCI/PCIe Gigabit Ethernet controllers,
	  has been added.  For more details, see &man.bce.4;.</para>

	<para>A bug which prevents the &man.bfe.4; driver from working
	  on a system with over 1GB RAM has been fixed.</para>

	<para>The &man.bge.4; driver now supports &man.polling.4; mode.</para>

	<para>The &man.em.4; driver now supports big-endian
	  architectures such as sparc64.</para>

	<para>The &man.le.4; driver, which supports AMD Am7900 LANCE
	  and Am79C9xx PCnet NICs and is based on NetBSD's implementation,
	  has been added.  While the &man.lnc.4; driver also supports these
	  NICs, this driver has several advantages over it such as
	  MPSAFE, ALTQ, VLAN_MTU, ifmedia, and 32-bit DMA for PCI
	  variants.</para>

	<para>The &man.lge.4; driver is now MPSAFE.</para>
      </sect4>
    </sect3>

    <sect3 id="net-proto">
      <title>Network Protocols</title>

      <para>The &man.arp.8; retransmission algorithm has been
	rewritten as that ARP requests are retransmitted without
	suppression, while there is demand for such ARP entry.
	Due to this change, a sysctl variable
	<varname>net.link.ether.inet.host_down_time</varname>
	has been removed.</para>

      <para>The &man.arp.8; now supports a sysctl variable
	<varname>net.link.ether.inet.log_arp_permanent_modify</varname>
	to suppress logging of attempts to modify
	permanent ARP entries.</para>

      <para>The &man.if.bridge.4; bridge driver now supports
	creating span ports, which transmit a copy of every frame
	received by the bridge.  This feature can be enabled
	by using &man.ifconfig.8;.</para>

      <para>The &man.if.bridge.4; bridge driver now supports
	RFC 3378 EtherIP.  This change makes it possible to
	add &man.gif.4; interfaces to bridges, which will then
	send and receive IP protocol 97 packets.
	Packets are Ethernet frames with an EtherIP header prepended.</para>

      <para>The &man.ipfw.4; IP packet filter now supports IPv6.
	The &man.ip6fw.8; packet filter is deprecated and will be removed
	in the future releases.</para>

      <para>The &man.ipfw.4; now supports substitution of the action
	argument with the value obtained from table lookup,
	which allows some optimization of rulesets.
	This is now applicable only to <literal>pipe</literal>,
	<literal>queue</literal>,
	<literal>divert</literal>,
	<literal>tee</literal>,
	<literal>netgraph</literal>,
	and <literal>ngtee</literal> rules.
	For example, the following rules will throw different
	packets to different pipes:</para>

      <programlisting>pipe 1000 config bw 1000Kbyte/s
pipe 4000 config bw 4000Kbyte/s
table 1 add x.x.x.x 1000
table 1 add x.x.x.y 4000
pipe tablearg ip from table(1) to any</programlisting>

      <para>A bug has been fixed in which NFS over TCP would not reconnect
	when the server sent a FIN.  This problem had occurred
	with Solaris NFS servers.</para>

      <para>The &man.ng.iface.4; Netgraph node now supports &man.altq.4;.</para>

      <para>The path MTU discovery for multicast packets in the &os;
	&man.ip6.4; stack has been disabled by default because
	notifying path MTU by a lot of routers in multicast
	can be a kind of distributed Denial-of-Service attack to a router.
	This feature can be re-enabled by using a new sysctl variable
	<varname>net.inet6.ip6.mcast_pmtu</varname>.</para>

      <para>The TCP bandwidth-delay product limiting feature has
	been disabled when the RTT is below a certain threshold.
	This optimization does not make sense on a LAN as it has
	trouble figuring out the maximal bandwidth due to the coarse
	tick granularity.  A new sysctl variable
	<varname>net.inet.tcp.inflight.rttthresh</varname> specifies
	the threshold in milliseconds below which this feature
	will disengage.  It defaults to 10ms.</para>
    </sect3>

    <sect3 id="disks">
      <title>Disks and Storage</title>

      <para>The &man.amr.4; driver has been improved on its performance
	and now supports full 64-bit DMA.  While this feature is
	enabled by default, this can be forced off by setting the
	<varname>hw.amr.force_sg32</varname> loader tunable for
	debugging purpose.</para>

      <para>The &man.amr.4; driver now supports &man.ioctl.2; requests
	necessary for Linux LSI MegaRaid tools on &os;'s Linux emulation
	environment.</para>

      <para>The &man.ata.4; driver now supports a workaround
	for some controllers whose DMA does not work properly
	in 48bit mode.  For the suspicious controllers
	the PIO mode will be used for access to over 137GB areas.</para>

      <para>The &man.ata.4; driver now supports the ITE IT8211F IDE controller,
	and Promise PDC40718 and PDC40719 chip found in Promise
	Fasttrak TX4300.</para>

      <para>The &man.ata.4; driver now supports DMA for kernel crash dump
	and crash dumping to &man.ataraid.4; device.</para>

      <para>The &man.ataraid.4; driver now supports
	JMicron ATA RAID metadata.</para>

      <para>The <literal>GEOM_LABEL</literal> class now supports
	Ext2FS, NTFS, and ReiserFS.</para>

      <para>The <literal>GEOM_MIRROR</literal> class now supports
	kernel crash dump to the GEOM providers.</para>

      <para>The <literal>GEOM_MIRROR</literal> and <literal>GEOM_RAID3</literal>
	classes now support sysctl variables
	<varname>kern.geom.mirror.disconnect_on_failure</varname>
	and
	<varname>kern.geom.graid3.disconnect_on_failure</varname>
	to control whether failed components will be disconnected or not.
	The default value is <literal>1</literal> to preserve the current
	behavior, and if it is set to <literal>0</literal> such components
	are not disconnected and the kernel will try to still use them
	(only first error will be logged).
	This is helpful for the case of multiple broken components (in
	different places), so actually all data is available.
	The broken components will be visible in <command>gmirror list</command>
	or <command>graid3 list</command> output with flag
	<literal>BROKEN</literal>.</para>

      <para>The <literal>GEOM_MIRROR</literal> and <literal>GEOM_RAID3</literal>
	classes now use parallel I/O request for synchronization
	to improve the performance.  New sysctl variables
	<varname>kern.geom.mirror.sync_requests</varname> and
	<varname>kern.geom.raid3.sync_requests</varname>
	define how many parallel I/O requests should be used.
	Also, sysctl variables
	<varname>kern.geom.mirror.reqs_per_sync</varname>,
	<varname>kern.geom.mirror.syncs_per_sec</varname>,
	<varname>kern.geom.raid3.reqs_per_sync</varname>, and
	<varname>kern.geom.raid3.syncs_per_sec</varname>
	are deprecated and have been removed.</para>

      <para>A new GEOM class <literal>GEOM_ZERO</literal> has been added.
	It creates very huge provider (41PB) <filename>/dev/gzero</filename>
	and mainly for performance testing.
	On <literal>BIO_READ</literal> request it zero-fills
	<varname>bio_data</varname> and on <literal>BIO_WRITE</literal>
	it does nothing.</para>

      <para>The &man.twa.4; driver has been updated to the 9.3.0.1
	release on the 3ware Web site.</para>

      <para>The &man.geli.8; now supports loading keyfiles before root
	file system is mounted.
	For example, the following entries
	can be used in <filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename> to enable
	it:</para>

      <programlisting>geli_da0_keyfile0_load="YES"
geli_da0_keyfile0_type="da0:geli_keyfile0"
geli_da0_keyfile0_name="/boot/keys/da0.key0"

      <para>The &man.mfi.4; driver, which supports
	the LSI MegaRAID SAS controller family, has been added.</para>

      <para>The &man.rr232x.4; driver, which supports HighPoint's
	RocketRAID 232x series of RAID controllers, has been added.</para>

      <para>The <filename>bluetooth</filename> script
	has been added.  This script will be called from
	&man.devd.8; in response to device attachment/detachment
	events and to stop/start particular device without unplugging
	it by hand.  The configuration parameters are in
	<filename>/etc/defaults/bluetooth.device.conf</filename>,
	and can be overridden by using

	(where <replaceable>$device</replaceable> is <devicename>ubt0</devicename>,
	<devicename>btcc0</devicename>, and so on.)
	For more details, see &man.bluetooth.conf.5;.</para>

      <para>The <filename>hcsecd</filename> and
	<filename>sdpd</filename> scripts have been added
	for &man.hcsecd.8; and &man.sdpd.8; daemons.
	These daemons can run even if no Bluetooth devices
	are attached to the system, but both daemons depend on
	Bluetooth socket layer and thus disabled by default.
	Bluetooth sockets layer must be either loaded
	as a module or compiled into kernel before the daemons can run.</para>

	option which create an IP alias on the given interface.</para>

      <para>The <filename>netif</filename> script now supports
	<varname>ipv4_addrs_<replaceable>ifn</replaceable></varname>,
	which adds one or more IPv4 address from a ranged list in
	CIRD notation.  For example:</para>

      <programlisting>ipv4_addrs_ed0="192.168.0.1/24 192.168.1.1-5/28"</programlisting>

    <para>The suffix of startup scripts from the Ports Collection
      has been removed.  This means <filename>foo.sh</filename>

      scripts whose name is something like
      <filename>foo.ORG</filename> will also be invoked.
      You are recommended to reinstall packages which install
      such scripts and remove extra files in the
