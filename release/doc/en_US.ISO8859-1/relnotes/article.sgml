  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>This document contains the release notes for &os;
    &release.current;.  It
    describes recently added, changed, or deleted features of &os;.
    It also provides some notes on upgrading
    from previous versions of &os;.</para>

  <para>All users are encouraged to consult the release errata before
    installing &os;.  The errata document is updated with
    <quote>late-breaking</quote> information discovered late in the
    release cycle or after the release.  Typically, it contains
    information on known bugs, security advisories, and corrections to
    documentation.  An up-to-date copy of the errata for &os;
    &release.current; can be found on the &os; Web site.</para>

  <title>What's New</title>

  <para>This section describes
    the most user-visible new or changed features in &os;
    since &release.prev;.
    In general, changes described here are unique to the &release.branch;
    branch unless specifically marked as &merged; features.
  </para>

  <para>Typical release note items
    document recent security advisories issued after
    &release.prev;,
    new drivers or hardware support, new commands or options,
    major bug fixes, or contributed software upgrades.  They may also
    list changes to major ports/packages or release engineering
    practices.  Clearly the release notes cannot list every single
    change made to &os; between releases; this document focuses
    primarily on security advisories, user-visible changes, and major
    architectural improvements.</para>

  <sect2 id="kernel">
    <title>Kernel Changes</title>

    
<para>&man.acpi.4; now has support for the HPET time counter.  &merged;</para>

    <para>The &man.acpi.ibm.4; driver now supports setting the fan control
      mode to manual or automatic, and adjusting the fan speed if the
      fan control mode is manual.  To enable manual control of the fan speed,
      the sysctl variable <varname>dev.acpi_ibm.<replaceable>0</replaceable>.fan</varname>
      needs to be set to zero (manual).  This should only be used with
      extreme precaution, as disabling automatic fan control might
      overheat the hardware and lead to permanent damage.</para>

    <para>The &man.apm.4; suspend/resume support has been improved.</para>

    <para>The &man.cpufreq.4; CPU frequency control framework is now
      enabled in the <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel.</para>

    <para>Support for the Camellia block cipher has been added to the
      &os; kernel.  It can now be specified as a cipher in &man.ipsec.4;
      and &man.geli.8;.  More information on Camellia can be found in
      RFC 4132.</para>

    <para>The <literal>options COMPAT_43</literal> kernel
      configuration option has been deemed unnecessary and has been
      removed from <filename>GENERIC</filename> and related kernel
      configurations.  This change may result in a small performance
      increase for some workloads.</para>

    <para>The dumb console driver (&man.dcons.4;) is now enabled in the
      <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel.</para>

    <para>The &man.ddb.4; debugger now provides the <literal>show sleepq</literal>
      command.  This takes a wait channel as an argument and looks
      for a sleep queue associated with that wait channel.</para>

    <para>A bug in file descriptor handling such that a simple
      <literal>close(0); dup(fd)</literal> sequence does not return
      descriptor <literal>0</literal> in some cases, has been fixed.</para>

    <para>The &man.gdb.1; remote debugging interface now supports
      copying console messages to a remote debugger instance.
      To enable this, set <literal>debug.gdbcons="1"</literal>
      in <filename>loader.conf</filename>, enter <literal>boot -d;
	gdb; step</literal> from the loader prompt,
      then attach &man.gdb.1; from a remote machine.
      The sysctl variable <varname>debug.gdbcons</varname> can be
      used to turn on/off this functionality.</para>

    <para>&man.hwpmc.4; and &man.pmcstat.8; now support profiling
      of dynamically loaded kernel modules and
      shared objects loaded with &man.dlopen.3;.</para>

    <para>A new <varname>kern.hostuuid</varname> sysctl variable
      has been added to hold a host's Universally Unique Identifier
      (UUID).  This UUID is computed or generated by a new
      <filename>rc.d/hostid</filename> startup script and, where
      possible, is saved to disk to be persistent across reboots.</para>

    <para>The <option>INCLUDE_CONFIG_FILE</option> kernel configuration
      option has been improved.  The full configuration of a running kernel
      can now be obtained via <command>sysctl -b kern.conftxt</command>.
      It can also be extracted from a kernel file via
      <command>config -x kernelfile</command>.  To preserve the literal
      kernel configuration with all the comments included, the
      <option>-C</option> option of &man.config.8; can be used.</para>

    <para>Support for Kernel Scheduled Entities (KSE) is now a kernel
      option (previously it was a mandatory feature in the kernel).
      It is enabled in the GENERIC kernel (thus there is no change in
      functionality) for all platforms except &arch.sun4v;.</para>

    <para>The Linux ABI support was enhanced to support emulation of
      Linux 2.6.16.  This is not enabled by default.  To turn it on
      the <varname>compat.linux.osrelease</varname> sysctl variable
      has to be set to <literal>2.6.16</literal>.  Note that this
      support is still experimental.</para>

    <para>Support for Message Signaled Interrupts (MSI) and Extended
      Message Signaled Interrupts (MSI-X) has been added to the kernel's
      PCI support code.  &merged;</para>

    <para>The &man.priv.9; kernel interface has been added.  Its purpose
      is checking the availability of privilege for threads and credentials.
      Unlike the existing &man.suser.9; interface, &man.priv.9; exposes a
      named privilege identifier to the privilege checking code, allowing
      more complex policies regarding the granting of privilege to be
      expressed.</para>

    <para>&os; now supports concurrent &man.read.2;/&man.readv.2;
      access to a file.</para>

    <para>The kernel's &man.sx.9; locks have been optimized to use
      simple atomic operations for the common cases of obtaining and 
      releasing shared and exclusive locks.  While this change is not
      generally user-visible, it is the basis for some substantial
      performance improvements.</para>

    <para>The ULE process scheduler has been revised to improve its
      behavior, in particular interactivity under load, for both
      uniprocessor and multiprocessor machines.  This
      implementation has commonly been referred to as <quote>ULE
      3.0</quote>.  (ULE 3.0 was formerly known as SCHED_SMP,
      which in turn was based on version 2.0 of the ULE scheduler.
      ULE 2.0 was never a part of any &os; release, however it
      was the subject of many development, testing, and
      benchmarking efforts.)</para>

    <para>The <literal>SIGCHLD</literal> signal queuing has been
      added.  For each child process whose status has been changed,
      a <literal>SIGCHLD</literal> instance is queued.  If the signal is still pending,
      and the process changed status several times, the signal information
      is updated to reflect the latest process status.
      There is a loader tunable <varname>kern.sigqueue.queue_sigchild</varname>
      which can control the behavior, setting it to zero disables the
      <literal>SIGCHLD</literal> queuing feature.</para>

    <para>A new sysctl variable <varname>kern.malloc_stats</varname>
      has been added.  This allows exporting of kernel malloc
      statistics via a binary structure stream.</para>

    <para>A new sysctl variable <varname>kern.forcesigexit</varname>
      has been added.  This forces a process
      to sigexit if a trap signal is being held by the current thread or
      ignored by the current process.  It is enabled by default.</para>

    <para>The pcvt(4) driver, an alternative to &man.syscons.4;,
      has been removed, as it had fallen out of sync with the rest
      of the kernel.</para>

    <para>RedZone, a buffer corruption protection for the kernel &man.malloc.9;
      facility has been implemented.  This detects both buffer underflows and
      overflows at runtime on &man.free.9; and &man.realloc.9;,
      and prints backtraces from where memory was allocated and from where
      it was freed.  For more details, see the &man.redzone.9; manual page.</para>

    <para>A new loader tunable <varname>vm.kmem_size_min</varname> has been
      added.  This allows to specify a minimal size for
      <varname>vm.kmem_size</varname>.</para>

    <para>A new sysctl variable <varname>vm.zone_stats</varname>
      has been added.  This allows to export &man.uma.9; allocator
      statistics via a binary structure stream.</para>

    <para>The sysctl variable <varname>hw.pci.do_powerstate</varname>
      has been split into two sysctl variables
      <varname>hw.pci.do_powerstate_nodriver</varname>
      and <varname>hw.pci.do_powerstate_resume</varname>.
      Also, these variables have been changed from a boolean to a range.
      <literal>0</literal> means no power management,
      <literal>1</literal> means conservative power management which
      any device class that has caused problems is added to the watch list,
      <literal>2</literal> means aggressive power management where
      any device class that is not fundamental to the system is added to the list,
      and <literal>3</literal> means power them all down unconditionally.
      The default values are <literal>0</literal> for
      <varname>hw.pci.do_powerstate_nodriver</varname> and
      <literal>1</literal> for <varname>hw.pci.do_powerstate_resume</varname>.</para>

    <para>[&arch.ia64;] The <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel now enables
      SMP support by default.</para>

    <para>Sample kernel configuration files
      <filename>src/sys/<replaceable>arch</replaceable>/conf/MAC</filename>
      for the Mandatory Access Control framework have been added.</para>

    <para><varname>POSIX_TIMERS</varname> support has been updated to 200112L.</para>

    <para>An experimental support for POSIX message queue has been
      implemented.</para>

    <para>The locking strategy for UNIX domain sockets has been
      revised to improve concurrency; this change has yielded
      substantial performance improvements on various SMP workloads
      (in particular, MySQL on 8-way &arch.amd64; systems) with little
      or no measured overhead on UP systems.</para>

    <para>Several minor but widespread changes to the Newbus API have
      been made In order to support some on-going work with interrupt
      filtering.  Because this change also breaks the kernel ABI, all
      third-party device drivers will need to be modified and
      recompiled.</para>

    <sect3 id="boot">
      <title>Boot Loader Changes</title>

      <para>A new option <option>-S</option>,
	which allows setting the <filename>boot2</filename>
	serial console speed in the <filename>/boot.config</filename>
	file or on the <prompt>boot:</prompt> prompt line,
	has been added.</para>

      <para>[&arch.amd64;, &arch.i386;] &man.firewire.4; and &man.dcons.4;
	support has been added to the boot loader.  To enable it,
	<literal>LOADER_FIREWIRE_SUPPORT=yes</literal> has to be added
	to <filename>/etc/make.conf</filename> and the loader be rebuilt.
	</para>

      <!-- Above this line, order boot loader changes by keyword-->

      version 2 and its C binding described in RFC2743 and RFC2744
      has been added.  This is a new extensible GSS-API layer which
      can support GSS-API plugins, similar the the Solaris
      implementation, and the Kerberos 5 GSS mechanism has
      been rewritten as a plugin library for the new implementation.</para>

      option to open kmem-based targets in read-write mode.
      This allows one to use kgdb on <filename>/dev/mem</filename>
      and be able to patch memory on a live system.</para>

      updated from the NetBSD source tree as of August 2005.</para>

    <para>The <application>libm</application> library now includes
      initial implementation of symbol maps and symbol version
      definitions.</para>

    <para>A new &man.malloc.3; implementation has been introduced.
      This implementation, sometimes referred to
      as <quote>jemalloc</quote>, was designed to improve the
      performance of multi-threaded programs, particularly on SMP
      systems, while preserving the performance of single-threaded
      programs.  Due to the use of different algorithms and data
      structures, jemalloc may expose some previously-unknown bugs in
      userland code, although most of the &os; base system and common
      ports have been tested and/or fixed.  Note that jemalloc uses
      &man.mmap.2; to obtain memory and only uses &man.sbrk.2; under
      limited circumstances (and then only for 32-bit architectures).
      As a result, the <literal>datasize</literal> resource limit
      has little practical effect for typical applications.  The
      <literal>vmemoryuse</literal> resource limit, however, can be
      used to bound the total virtual memory used by a process, as
      described in &man.limits.1;.</para>

    <para>The &man.mdconfig.8; utility now supports producing
      device listings formatted as XML.  Currently, the
      <command>list</command> and <command>query</command>
      sub-commands support this feature.</para>

    <para>The &man.mdconfig.8; utility's <option>-u</option> option
      now supports specifying multiple devices separated
      by comma character.</para>

    <para>The &man.mdmfs.8; utility now supports a <option>-P</option> flag
      to allow skipping the &man.newfs.8; process
      when using a vnode-backed disk.</para>

    <para>The &man.mdmfs.8; utility now supports a <option>-E</option> flag
      to allow to specify location of the &man.mdconfig.8;
      utility instead of using the default one
      (<filename>/sbin/mdconfig</filename>).</para>

    <para>A new function &man.memmem.3; has been implemented in
      <filename>libc</filename>.  This is the binary equivalent to
      &man.strstr.3; and found in <filename>glibc</filename>.</para>

    <para>The &man.mount.8; <literal>dev</literal>
      and <literal>nodev</literal> options have
      been removed.</para>

    <para>The &man.mount.8; utility now supports &man.mqueuefs.5;.</para>

    <para>A bug which prevents the &man.mount.8; utility from converting
      a read-only mount to read-write via <command>mount -u -o rw</command>,
      has been fixed.</para>

    <para>A number of the file
      system-specific <command>mount_<replaceable>*</replaceable></command>
      utilities have been removed, in favor of the more general
      &man.mount.8; command with a <option>-t</option> option.
      Specifically, these commands are:
      <command>mount_devfs</command>,
      <command>mount_ext2fs</command>,
      <command>mount_fdescfs</command>,
      <command>mount_linprocfs</command>,
      <command>mount_procfs</command>,
      <command>mount_std</command>,
      <command>mount_linsysfs</command>,
      <command>mount_reiserfs</command>, and
      <command>mount_umapfs</command>.
      </para>

    <para>The mrouted(8) multicast routing daemon has been removed
      from the &os; base system.  It implements the DVMRP multicast
      routing protocol, which has largely been replaced by PIM in many
      multicast installations.  The related map-mbone(8) and mrinfo(8)
      utilities have also been removed.  These programs are now
      available in the &os; Ports Collection
      as <filename role="package">net/mrouted</filename>.</para>

    <para>The &man.netstat.1; utility now supports printing
      &man.sctp.4; protocol statistics.</para>

    <para>The <filename>/etc/nsswitch.conf</filename> file is now
      installed statically instead of being generated on every
      reboot.</para>

    <para>The objformat(1) utility and getobjformat(3) library (the
      last remnants of a.out object file support) have been removed.</para>

    <para>The &man.pam.nologin.8; module no longer provides
      an authentication function; instead it now provides an account
      management function.  Third-party files in
      <filename>/usr/local/etc/pam.d</filename> may  
      need manual editing; specifically, lines in these files of
      the form:

      <screen>auth    required        pam_nologin.so  no_warn</screen></para>

    <para>These lines need to have the word <literal>auth</literal>
      replaced with the word <literal>account</literal>.</para>

    <para>&man.nscd.8; has been added.  It is a daemon that caches
      the results of nsswitch lookups (such as those to the password,
      group, and services databases) for improved performance.</para>

    <para>The &man.pkill.1; utility now supports a
      <option>-F</option> option which allows to
      restrict matches to a process whose PID is stored in the
      pidfile file.  When another new option <option>-L</option>
      is also specified, the pidfile file must be locked with the
      &man.flock.2; syscall or created with &man.pidfile.3;.</para>

    <para>The &man.pkill.1; utility now supports a
      <option>-I</option> flag which works like <option>-i</option>
      of &man.rm.1;.  When this flag is specified, &man.pkill.1;
      will ask for confirmation before sending a signal to
      each matching process.</para>

    <para>The &man.pmcstat.8; program has seen several enhancements:
      It can now log over a network socket to a remote host.  The
      <option>-c</option> now takes a comma-seperated list of CPUs
      to configure for PMC allocation.  The <option>-t</option> option
      has been enhanced to take a regular expression for selecting
      processes based on their command names.  &man.pmcstat.8; now
      allocates system PMCs on all CPUs by default, not just CPU 0.</para>

    <para>The &man.powerd.8; program now supports a
      <option>-P</option> option, which specifies a pidfile to use.</para>

    <para>The &man.pw.8; program now supports a <option>-M</option>
      option to set the permissions of a user's newly created home
      directory.  &merged;</para>

    <para>The DNS resolver library in &os;'s <application>libc</application>
      has been updated to that from BIND 9.4.1.</para>

    <para>The &man.rpcbind.8; program can now bind its TCP listening
      socket to an IP address other than INADDR_ANY using the
      <option>-h</option> flag.  The new <option>-6</option> flag allows
      it to bind to IPv6 addresses only.</para>

    <para>The &man.rpcgen.1; utility now generates headers and stub files
      that can be used with ANSI C compilers by default.</para>

    <para>The &man.rpc.lockd.8; and &man.rpc.statd.8; programs now
      accept <option>-p</option> options to indicate which port they
      should bind to. &merged;</para>

    <para>The &man.rtld.1; runtime linker now supports ELF symbol versioning
      using GNU semantics.  This implementation aims to be compatible
      with symbol versioning support as implemented by GNU libc and
      documented in <ulink url="http://people.redhat.com/~drepper/symbol-versioning"></ulink>
      and LSB 3.0.  Also, <function>dlvsym()</function>
      function has been added to
      allow lookups for a specific version of a given symbol.</para>

    <para>The &man.sa.8; utility now supports <option>-U</option>
      and <option>-P</option> flags.  They can be used to specify
      the per-user and per-process summary file location,
      respectively.</para>

    <para>The &man.sade.8; disk partitioning and labeling utility has
      been added.  This utility is based on the partition editing bits
      of &man.sysinstall.8;.</para>

    <para>A bug in the &man.sed.1; utility which can cause
      incorrect calculation of pattern space length in some cases
      has been fixed.</para>

    <para>The &man.sed.1; utility now supports case-insensitive
      pattern matching; this feature can be enabled by using
      the <literal>I</literal> flag after the closing delimiter for a
      regular expression.</para>

    <para>The behavior of the &man.setenv.3; family of library calls
      has been changed from the historic BSD API to the
      behavior mandated by POSIX.  As a result, several base system
      utility that relied on the old API have been updated to track
      this change.</para>

    <para>The <option>-h</option> flag to &man.setfacl.1; now properly
      sets the ACL on a symbolic link, not the link target.</para>

    <para>The &man.sockstat.1; utility, which shows connected and
      listening network sockets, now supports a new <option>-P</option>
      command-line option, which can be used to filter displayed sockets
      by protocol name (as listed in &man.protocols.5;).</para>

    <para>The &man.sysctl.8; utility now supports a <option>-q</option>
      flag to suppress a limited set of warnings and errors.</para>

    <para>The version of tcpslice in the &os; base system has been
      removed due to obsolescence.  A more up-to-date version can be
      found in the Ports Collection
      as <filename role="package">net/tcpslice</filename>.</para>

    <para>The &man.time.1; utility now prints the time that a given
      command has been running if sent a <literal>SIGINFO</literal> signal.</para>

    <para>The &man.top.1; program now supports a <option>-a</option>
      flag to display process titles from their argument vectors;
      this feature is useful for watching processes that change their
      titles via &man.setproctitle.3;.</para>

    <para>The &man.top.1; program now supports a <option>-j</option>
      flag to display the &man.jail.8; ID for each process.  &merged;</para>

    <para>The &man.touch.1; utility now supports a <option>-A</option>
      flag that allows the access and modification times of a file to be
      adjusted by a specified value.  &merged;</para>

    <para>The &man.truss.1; utility now supports an <option>-s</option>
      flag for the same functionality as the strace utility
      (<filename role="package">devel/strace</filename>).</para>

    <para>The &man.truss.1; utility no longer depends on the availability
      of the &man.procfs.5; file system; it uses the &man.ptrace.2;
      interface instead for controlling a traced process.</para>

    <para>[&arch.powerpc;] The &man.truss.1; utility now supports &os;/powerpc.</para>

    <para>The usbd(8) utility has been removed.
      The &man.devd.8; utility and its configuration
      file now support functionality which is equivalent to it.</para>

      <filename>/usr/bin</filename> to <filename>/bin</filename>.</para>

    <para>The vnconfig(8) utility, which was long ago replaced by
      &man.mdconfig.8;, has been removed.</para>

    <para>The wicontrol(8) utility has been removed.  Configuration
      functions for &man.wi.4; interfaces should be performed using
      &man.ifconfig.8;.</para>

    <para>The shared library version number of all libraries has
      been updated due to some possible ABI changes.  The libraries
      include: snmp_<replaceable>*</replaceable>, libdialog, libg2c, libobjc,
      libreadline, libregex, libstdc++, libkrb5, libalias, libarchive,
      libbegemot, libbluetooth, libbsnmp, libbz2, libc_r, libcrypt,

    <para>The <function>wcsdup()</function> function has been
      implemented.  This function is popular in Microsoft and GNU
      systems.</para>

    <para>The &man.wlandebug.8; utility has been added to the main
      &os; source tree (it previously lived in a tools area).  It
      provides control over a number of types of debugging output
      in the &man.wlan.4; module and related drivers, and can be
      useful for debugging wireless issues.</para>

    <para>The &man.wpa.passphrase.8; utility has been added.  It
      generates a 256-bit pre-shared WPA key from an ASCII
      passphrase. &merged;</para>

	This is a replacement of the <filename>ramdisk</filename>
	script, and all of variables in <varname>ramdisk_*</varname>
	have been changed to <varname>mdconfig_*</varname>.
	Also, two new &man.rc.conf.5; variables
	<varname>mdconfig_<replaceable>*</replaceable>_files</varname>

	of the boot process, has been added.</para>

      <para>The <filename>rc.initdiskless</filename> script now uses &man.tar.1;
	instead of &man.pax.1; because &man.pax.1; needs a writable

  <title>Upgrading from previous releases of &os;</title>

  <para>[&arch.i386;, &arch.amd64;] Beginning with &os; 6.2-RELEASE,
    binary upgrades between RELEASE versions (and snapshots of the
    various security branches) are supported using the
    &man.freebsd-update.8; utility.  The binary upgrade procedure will
    update unmodified userland utilities, as well as unmodified GENERIC or
    SMP kernels distributed as a part of an official &os; release.
    The &man.freebsd-update.8; utility requires that the host being
    upgraded have Internet connectivity.</para>

  <para>An older form of binary upgrade is supported through the
    <command>Upgrade</command> option from the main &man.sysinstall.8;
    menu on CDROM distribution media.  This type of binary upgrade
    may be useful on non-&arch.i386;, non-&arch.amd64; machines
    or on systems with no Internet connectivity.</para>

  <para>Source-based upgrades (those based on recompiling the &os;
    base system from source code) from previous versions are
    supported, according to the instructions in
    <filename>/usr/src/UPDATING</filename>.</para>

  <important>
    <para>Upgrading &os; should, of course, only be attempted after
      backing up <emphasis>all</emphasis> data and configuration
      files.</para>
