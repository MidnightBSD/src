  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>This document contains the release notes for &os;
    &release.current;.  It describes recently added, changed, or
    deleted features of &os;.  It also provides some notes on
    upgrading from previous versions of &os;.</para>

  <para>The latest, up-to-date version of the release notes are
    available online at <uri
      xlink:href="&release.url;10.0R/relnotes.html">&release.url;10.0R/relnotes.html</uri>.</para>

  <para>This distribution of &os;
    &release.current; is a &release.type; distribution.  It can be
    found at <uri xlink:href="&release.url;">&release.url;</uri> or
    any of its mirrors.  More information on obtaining this (or other)
    &release.type; distributions of &os; can be found in the <link

	&os;</quote> appendix</link> to the <link
      xlink:href="&url.books.handbook;/">&os; Handbook</link>.</para>

  <para>All users are encouraged to consult the release errata before
    installing &os;.  The errata document is updated with
    <quote>late-breaking</quote> information discovered late in the
    release cycle or after the release.  Typically, it contains
    information on known bugs, security advisories, and corrections to
    documentation.  An up-to-date copy of the errata for &os;
    &release.current; can be found on the &os; Web site.</para>

  <title>What's New</title>

  <para>This section describes the most user-visible new or changed
    features in &os; since &release.prev;.</para>

  <para>Typical release note items document recent security advisories
    issued after &release.prev;, new drivers or hardware support, new
    commands or options, major bug fixes, or contributed software
    upgrades.  They may also list changes to major ports/packages or
    release engineering practices.  Clearly the release notes cannot
    list every single change made to &os; between releases; this
    document focuses primarily on security advisories, user-visible
    changes, and major architectural improvements.</para>

    <title>Kernel Changes</title>

    <para revision="248508">The use of unmapped VMIO buffers
      eliminates the need to perform TLB shootdown for mapping on
      buffer creation and reuse, greatly reducing the amount of IPIs
      for shootdown on big-SMP machines and eliminating up to 25-30%
      of the system time on i/o intensive workloads.</para>

    <para arch="amd64" revision="254466">The maximum amount of memory
      the &os; kernel can address has been increased from 1TB to
      4TB.</para>

    <para>A new &man.cpuset.2; API has been added for thread to CPU
      binding and CPU resource grouping and assignment.  The
      &man.cpuset.1; userland utility has been added to allow
      manipulation of processor sets.</para>

    <para>The &man.ddb.4; kernel debugger now has an
      output capture facility.  Input and output from &man.ddb.4; can
      now be captured to a memory buffer for later inspection using
      &man.sysctl.8; or a textdump.  The new
      <command>capture</command> command controls this feature.</para>

    <para>The &man.ddb.4; debugger now supports a simple
      scripting facility, which supports a set of named scripts
      consisting of a set of &man.ddb.4; commands.  These commands can
      be managed from within &man.ddb.4; or with the use of the new
      &man.ddb.8; utility.  More details can be found in the
      &man.ddb.4; manual page.</para>

    <para>The kernel now supports a new textdump format
      of kernel dumps.  A textdump provides higher-level information
      via mechanically generated/extracted debugging output, rather
      than a simple memory dump.  This facility can be used to
      generate brief kernel bug reports that are rich in debugging
      information, but are not dependent on kernel symbol tables or
      precisely synchronized source code.  More information can be
      found in the &man.textdump.4; manual page.</para>

    <para>Kernel support for M:N threading has been removed.  While
      the KSE (Kernel Scheduled Entities) project was quite successful
      in bringing threading to FreeBSD, the M:N approach taken by the
      KSE library was never developed to its full potential.
      Backwards compatibility for applications using KSE threading
      will be provided via &man.libmap.conf.5; for dynamically linked
      binaries.  The &os; Project greatly appreciates the work of
      &a.julian;, &a.deischen;, and &a.davidxu; on KSE support.</para>

    <para>The &os; kernel now exports information about certain kernel
      features via the <varname>kern.features</varname> sysctl tree.
      The &man.feature.present.3; library call provides a convenient
      interface for user applications to test the presence of
      features.</para>

    <para arch="amd64">The &os; kernel now has support for large
      memory page mappings (<quote>superpages</quote>).</para>

    <para arch="amd64,i386,ia64,powerpc">The ULE
      scheduler is now the default process scheduler
      in <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernels.</para>

    <para arch="amd64,i386" revision="240135">Support was added for
      the new Intel on-CPU Bull Mountain random number
      generator, found on IvyBridge and supposedly later CPUs,
      accessible with the RDRAND instruction.</para>

    <sect3 xml:id="kernel-virtualization">
      <title>Virtualization support</title>
      <para arch="amd64" revision="245652">The BSD Hypervisor,
	&man.bhyve.8; is included with &os;.  &man.bhyve.8; requires
	Intel CPUs with VT-x and Extended Page Table (EPT) support.
	These features are on all Nehalem models and beyond (e.g.
	Nehalem and newer), but not on the lower-end Atom CPUs.</para>

      <para revision="227652">&man.virtio.4; support has been added.
	&man.virtio.4; is the name for the paravirtualization
	interface developed for the Linux KVM, but since adopted to
	other virtual machine hypervisors (with the notable exception
	of Xen).  This work brings in a BSD-licensed clean-room
	implementation of the virtio kernel drivers for disk IO
	(&man.virtio_blk.4; and &man.virtio_scsi.4;), network IO
	(&man.vtnet.4;), memory ballooning (&man.virtio_balloon.4;),
	and PCI.  Tested with on Qemu/KVM, VirtualBox, and
	&man.bhyve.4;.</para>

      <para arch="amd64,i386" revision="255524">Paravirtualized
	drivers which support Microsoft Hyper-V have been imported and
	made part of the amd64 GENERIC kernel.  For i386, these
	drivers are not part of GENERIC, so the following lines must
	be added to <filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename> to load
	these drivers:</para>

      <programlisting>hv_ata_pci_disengage_load="YES"
hv_netsvc_load="YES"
hv_utils_load="YES"
hv_vmbus_load="YES"</programlisting>

      <para>Alternatively, the Hyper-V drivers can be added to the
	i386 kernel by adding <literal>device hyperv</literal> to the
	kernel config, and then recompiling the kernel.  Please refer
	to <link xlink:href="http://wiki.freebsd.org/HyperV">FreeBSD
	  and Microsoft Windows Server Hyper-V support</link> for full
	instructions on how to set up Hyper-V support under
	FreeBSD.</para>

      <para revision="254738">The &man.vmx.4; driver has been added.
	&man.vmx.4; is a VMware VMXNET3 ethernet driver ported from
	OpenBSD.</para>

      <para revision="255744" arch="amd64,i386">Xen PVHVM

      <para revision="253396">The default ABI on ARM is now the ARM
	EABI. This brings a number of improvements and allows future
	support for VFP and Thumb-2.</para>

      <para revision="239268">ARM support has been greatly improved,
	including support for ARMv6 and ARMv7, SMP and thread-local
	storage (TLS).  Additionally support for some newer SoC like
	the MV78x60 and OMAP4 was added.  See the <link
	  xlink:href="http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-arm/2012-August/003757.html">announcement</link>
	for further details.</para>

      <para revision="254918">Superpages support on ARM has been
	added.  Superpages support provides improved performance and
	scalability by allowing TLB translations to dynamically cover
	large physical memory regions.  All ARMv6 and ARMv7-based
	platforms can take advantage of this feature.  See the <link
	  xlink:href="https://wiki.freebsd.org/ARMSuperpages">ARM

      <title>Boot Loader Changes</title>

      <para arch="amd64,i386">The BTX kernel used by the

	mode.  This change makes it possible to boot &os; from USB
	devices.</para>

      <para arch="amd64,i386">A new &man.gptboot.8; boot

	  It also saves space if snapshots are in use.  This
	  improvement only works on datasets with enabled compression,

	  compare the checksums of incoming writes to the checksum of
	  the existing on-disk data and avoid issuing any write I/O
	  for data that has not changed. This will reduce I/O as well
	  as space usage because if the old block is referenced by
	  a snapshot, both copies of the block are kept even though
	  both contain the same data.</para>
