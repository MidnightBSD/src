        <question>
          <para>I go to boot from the hard disk for the first time
          after installing &os;, the kernel loads and probes my
          hardware, but stops with messages like:</para>

          <screen>changing root device to wd1s1a panic: cannot mount root</screen>
          <para>What is wrong?  What can I do?</para>

          <para>What is this
          <literal>bios_drive:interface(unit,partition)kernel_name</literal>
          thing that is displayed with the boot help?</para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>There is a longstanding problem in the case where the
          boot disk is not the first disk in the system.  The BIOS
          uses a different numbering scheme to &os;, and working
          out which numbers correspond to which is difficult to get
          right.</para>

          <para>In the case where the boot disk is not the first disk
          in the system, &os; can need some help finding it.  There
          are two common situations here, and in both of these cases,
          you need to tell &os; where the root filesystem is.  You
          do this by specifying the BIOS disk number, the disk type
          and the &os; disk number for that type.</para>

          <para>The first situation is where you have two IDE disks,
          each configured as the master on their respective IDE
          busses, and wish to boot &os; from the second disk.  The
          BIOS sees these as disk 0 and disk 1, while &os; sees
          them as <devicename>wd0</devicename> and
          <devicename>wd2</devicename>.</para>

          <para>&os; is on BIOS disk 1, of type
          <literal>wd</literal> and the &os; disk number is 2, so
          you would say:</para>

          <screen><userinput>1:wd(2,a)kernel</userinput></screen>

          <para>Note that if you have a slave on the primary bus, the
          above is not necessary (and is effectively wrong).</para>

          <para>The second situation involves booting from a SCSI disk
          when you have one or more IDE disks in the system.  In this
          case, the &os; disk number is lower than the BIOS disk
          number.  If you have two IDE disks as well as the SCSI disk,
          the SCSI disk is BIOS disk 2, type <literal>da</literal> and
          &os; disk number 0, so you would say:</para>

          <screen><userinput>2:da(0,a)kernel</userinput></screen>

          <para>To tell &os; that you want to boot from BIOS disk
          2, which is the first SCSI disk in the system.  If you only
          had one IDE disk, you would use '1:' instead.</para>

          <para>Once you have determined the correct values to use,
          you can put the command exactly as you would have typed it
          in the <filename>/boot.config</filename> file using a
          standard text editor.  Unless instructed otherwise, &os;
          will use the contents of this file as the default response
          to the <literal>boot:</literal> prompt.</para>

	  <para>I go to boot from the hard disk for the first time

          the boot won't go any further.</para>
	</question>
	<answer>
          <para>The hard disk geometry was set incorrectly in the
          Partition editor when you installed &os;.  Go back into
          the partition editor and specify the actual geometry of your
          hard disk.  You must reinstall &os; again from the
          beginning with the correct geometry.</para>

          <para>If you are failing entirely in figuring out the
	  correct geometry for your machine, here's a tip: Install a
	  small DOS partition at the beginning of the disk and install
	  &os; after that.  The install program will see the DOS
	  partition and try to infer the correct geometry from it,
	  which usually works.</para>

	  <para>The following tip is no longer recommended, but is left here
	  for reference:</para>

	  <blockquote>
            <para>If you are setting up a truly dedicated &os;
	    server or workstation where you don't care for (future)
	    compatibility with DOS, Linux or another operating system,
	    you've also got the option to use the entire disk (`A' in
	    the partition editor), selecting the non-standard option
	    where &os; occupies the entire disk from the very first
	    to the very last sector.  This will leave all geometry
	    considerations aside, but is somewhat limiting unless
	    you're never going to run anything other than &os; on a
	    disk.</para>

        <question>
	  <para>&os; claims to support the 3Com PCMCIA card, but my
	  card isn't recognized when it's plugged into my
	  laptop.</para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>There are a couple of possible problems.  First of
	  all, &os; does not support multi-function cards, so if
	  you have a combo Ethernet/modem card (such as the 3C562), it
	  won't work.  The default driver for the 3C589 card was
	  written just like all of the other drivers in &os;, and
	  depend on the card's own configuration data stored in NVRAM
	  to work.  You must correctly configure &os;'s driver to
	  match the IRQ, port, and IOMEM stored in NVRAM.</para>

	  <para>Unfortunately, the only program capable of reading
	  them is the 3COM supplied DOS program.  This program must be
	  run on an absolutely clean system (no other drivers must be
	  running), and the program will whine about CARD-Services not
	  being found, but it will continue.  This is necessary to
	  read the NVRAM values.  You want to know the IRQ, port, and
	  IOMEM values (the latter is called the CIS tuple by 3COM).
	  The first two can be set in the program, the third is
	  un-settable, and can only be read.  Once you have these
	  values, set them in UserConfig and your card will be
	  recognized.</para>

        <question>
	  <para>&os; finds my PCMCIA network card, but no packets
	  appear to be sent even though it claims to be working.</para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>Many PCMCIA cards have the ability to use either the
	  10-Base2 (BNC) or 10-BaseT connectors for connecting to the
	  network.  The driver is unable to <quote>auto-select</quote>
	  the correct connector, so you must tell it which connector
	  to use. In order to switch between the two connectors, the
	  link flags must be set.  Depending on the model of the card,
	  <option>-link0 link1</option> or <option>-link0
	  -link1</option> will choose the correct network connector.
	  You can set these in &man.sysinstall.8; by using the
	  <literal>Extra options to ifconfig:</literal> field in the
	  network setup screen.</para>
	</answer>

        <question>
	  <para>The system finds my &man.ed.4; network card, but I
          keep getting device timeout errors.</para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>Your card is probably on a different IRQ from what is
	  specified in the kernel configuration.  The ed driver does
	  not use the `soft' configuration by default (values entered
	  using EZSETUP in DOS), but it will use the software
	  configuration if you specify <literal>?</literal> in the IRQ field of your
	  kernel config file.</para>

	  <para>Either move the jumper on the card to a hard
          configuration setting (altering the kernel settings if
          necessary), or specify the IRQ as <literal>-1</literal> in UserConfig or <literal>?</literal> 
          in your kernel config file.  This will tell the kernel to
          use the soft configuration.</para>

          <para>Another possibility is that your card is at IRQ 9,
          which is shared by IRQ 2 and frequently a cause of problems
          (especially when you have a VGA card using IRQ 2!).  You
          should not use IRQ 2 or 9 if at all possible.</para>

        <question>
	  <para>I have a Matsushita/Panasonic drive but it isn't
	  recognized by the system.</para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>Make certain that the I/O port that the &man.matcd.4; driver
          is set to is correct for the host interface card you have.
          (Some SoundBlaster DOS drivers report a hardware I/O port
          address for the CD-ROM interface that is 0x10 lower than it
          really is.)</para>

          <para>If you are unable to determine the settings for the
          card by examining the board or documentation, you can use
          UserConfig to change the 'port' address (I/O port) to -1 and
          start the system.  This setting causes the driver to look at
          a number of I/O ports that various manufacturers use for
          their Matsushita/Panasonic/Creative CD-ROM interfaces.  Once
          the driver locates the address, you should run UserConfig
          again and specify the correct address.  Leaving the 'port'
          parameter set to -1 increases the amount of time that it
          takes the system to boot, and this could interfere with
          other devices.</para>

	</question>
	<answer>
          <para>Older IBM laptops use a non-standard keyboard
          controller, so you must tell the keyboard driver (atkbd0) to
          go into a special mode which works on the ThinkPads.  Change
          the atkbd0 'Flags' to 0x4 in UserConfig and it should work
          fine.  (Look in the Input Menu for 'Keyboard'.)</para>

	  <para>With Compaq being always a little different from other

          screen, and set the Flags value of the fdc0 device to 0x1.
          This pretends the existence of the first floppy drive (as a

        <question>
	  <para>I have an IBM EtherJet PCI card, it is detected by the
          &man.fxp.4; driver correctly, but the lights on the card don't
          come on and it doesn't connect to the network.</para>
        </question>
	<answer>
	  <para>We don't understand why this happens.  Neither do IBM
          (we asked them).  The card is a standard Intel EtherExpress
          Pro/100 with an IBM label on it, and these cards normally
          work just fine.  You may see these symptoms only in some IBM
          Netfinity servers.  The only solution is to install a
          different Ethernet adapter.</para>

        <question>
	  <para>When I configure the network during installation on an
          IBM Netfinity 3500, the system freezes.</para>
        </question>
	<answer>
	  <para>There is a problem with the onboard Ethernet in the
          Netfinity 3500 which we have not been able to identify at
          this time.  It may be related to the SMP features of the
          system being misconfigured.  You will have to install
          another Ethernet adapter and avoid attempting to configure
          the onboard adapter at any time.</para>

        <question>
	  <para>When I install onto a drive managed by a Mylex PCI
          RAID controller, the system fails to boot (eg. with a
          <literal>read error</literal> message).</para>
        </question>
	<answer>
	  <para>There is a bug in the Mylex driver which results in it
          ignoring the <quote>8GB</quote> geometry mode setting in the
          BIOS.  Use the 2GB mode instead.</para>
