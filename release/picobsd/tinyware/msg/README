This program replaces 'dmesg' utility, aand allows you to retrieve the
system's message buffer without resorting to such dirty tricks as normal
'dmesg' uses (using libkvm and /dev/kmem to directly read kernel
memory.. *shudder*).

This utility uses sysctl(3) interface. The mib variable it uses was
recently added to the kernel sources, so if you don't mind patching your
kernel tree, contact me directly - the patches are very small and simple.
