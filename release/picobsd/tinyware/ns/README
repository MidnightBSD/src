			Small replacement for netstat
			-----------------------------

This program implements some basic functionality subset of normal netstat -
it can display the routing table and protocol statistics.

Large part of the code dealing with retrieving the routing table via sysctl(3)
was taken from code examples written by Richard Stevens to accompany his
excellent book.

Usage
-----

	ns [-rsi] [-p proto] [-w wait]

where

	-r	print routing table (default)
	-s	print protocol statistics
	-i	print interface statistics
	-p proto	display only statistics related to this
			protocol, where 'proto' is one of:
			- ip
			- tcp
			- udp
			- icmp
			- bdg - bridging stats, if 'ns' was compiled with
			   bridging support (flag BRIDGING in Makefile)
	-w wait	continuous display, repeat every 'wait' seconds.

Bugs
----

* 'ns' doesn't resolve IP addresses to names
* well, real netstat provides _much_ more information... but this one needs
  to be small, right? :-)
