This is a small 'ps' replacement, which uses information available via
procfs(5) interface. It's primitive, but gives you the most important
informations, i.e. how many processes are running and on which vty, and the
pid number to kill some of them. :-)

When I have some time, I'll add usual switches and other functions that normal
'ps' has...

Also, what I'm now inclined to think is that it should be reworked to use
more general (and less complicated) sysctl(3).
