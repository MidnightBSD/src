# configuration file for "bridge" floppy.
# Depending on your needs, almost surely you will need to
# modify your configuration to add/remove/change programs used in
# the floppy image. Remember that some programs also require
# matching kernel options to enable device drivers etc.
#
# Next to most of the programs i have tried to indicate the approximate
# space consumed, but beware that these values change from release
# to release, and might depend on the presence of other programs which
# share the same libraries.
#
# NOTE: the string "/usr/src" will be automatically replaced with the
# correct value set in 'build' script - you should change it there

# Default build options. Basically tell the Makefiles which understand
# that to use the most compact possible version of the code.
#
buildopts -DNO_PAM -DRELEASE_CRUNCH -DPPP_NO_NETGRAPH -DTRACEROUTE_NO_IPSEC -DNO_INET6

# directories where to look for sources of various binaries.
# @__CWD__@ is a magic keyword in the picobsd's (Makefile.conf)
# which is replaced with the picobsd directory.

# Some programs are especially written for PicoBSD and reside here
# Make this first in the list so we can override standard programs
# with the picobsd-specific ones.
