#
# This script is used by release/Makefile to build the (optional) ISO images
# for a FreeBSD release.  It is considered architecture dependent since each
# platform has a slightly unique way of making bootable CDs.  This script
# is also allowed to generate any number of images since that is more of
# publishing decision than anything else.
#
# Usage:
#
# mkisoimages.sh [-b] image-label image-name base-bits-dir [extra-bits-dir]
#
# Where -b is passed if the ISO image should be made "bootable" by
# whatever standards this architecture supports (may be unsupported),
# image-label is the ISO image label, image-name is the filename of the
# resulting ISO image, base-bits-dir contains the image contents and
# extra-bits-dir, if provided, contains additional files to be merged
# into base-bits-dir as part of making the image.
