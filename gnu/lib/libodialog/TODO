- cut off names in the listbox that are to long
done 27Jan95
	The current behaviour may not be desirable. When browsing through
	long names these, when highlighted, will be shown with the first
	characters cut off, when not highlighted the last characters will
	be cut off.

- look at behaviour of TAB key when browsing through directories.

- add (nn%) indication to lists.

- add use_helpfile()
done 13Feb95
- add use_helpline()

NOTE: apparently there is a bug (or a strange interaction between pkg_manage
and dialog_textbox) in dialog_textbox. When I use this routine to display 
the helpfile in display_helpfile() the program gets mysterious segmentation
faults and bus errors.
I now use dialog_mesgbox, after I have read the file into a buffer.
