.Sh NAME
.Nm manpath
.Nd determine user's search path for man pages
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl dLq
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility
tries to determine the user's manpath from a set of system
defaults and the user's
.Ev PATH ,
echoing the result to the standard output.
Warnings and errors are written to the standard error.
If a directory in the user's path is not listed in the
.Pa %manpath_config_file%
file,
.Nm
looks for the subdirectories
.Pa man
or
.Pa MAN .
If they exist, they are added to the search path.
If they do not exist, but the directory ends in
.Pa /bin ,
.Nm
replaces
.Pa /bin
with
.Pa /man
and checks if that directory exists.
If it exists, it is added to the search path.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility is used by
.Xr man 1
to determine the search path, so users normally do not need to set the
.Ev MANPATH
environment variable directly.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl d
Output additional debug information.
.It Fl L
Output man locales list (if it exists).
.It Fl q
Operate quietly.
Only echo the final result.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width ".Ev MANLOCALES" -compact

is set,
.Nm
echoes its value on the standard output and issues a warning on the
standard error.
.It Ev MANLOCALES
If
.Ev MANLOCALES
is set and
.Fl L
option is set,
.Nm
echoes its value on the standard output and issues a warning on the
standard error.
