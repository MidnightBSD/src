.Sh NAME
.Nm manpath
.Nd determine user's search path for man pages
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl dLq
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Manpath
tries to determine the user's manpath from a set of system
defaults and the user's
.Ev PATH ,
echoing the result to the standard output.
Warnings and errors are written to the standard error.
If a directory in the user's path is not listed in the
.Pa %manpath_config_file%
file,
.Nm
looks for the subdirectories
.Pa man
or
.Pa MAN .
If they exist, they are added to the search path.
If they do not exist, but the directory ends in
.Pa /bin ,
.Nm
replaces
.Pa /bin
with
.Pa /man
and checks if that directory exists.
If it exists, it is added to the search path.
.Pp
.Nm Manpath
is used by
.Xr man 1
to determine the search path, so users normally do not need to set the
.Ev MANPATH
environment variable directly.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl d
Output additional debug information.
.It Fl L
Output man locales list (if exist).
.It Fl q
Operate quietly.
Only echo the final result.
