.Sh NAME
.Nm man
.Nd format and display the on-line manual pages
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl adfhkotw
.Op Fl m Ar arch Ns Op : Ns Ar machine
.Op Fl p Ar string
.Op Fl M Ar path
.Op Fl P Ar pager
.Op Fl S Ar list
.Op Ar section
.Ar name ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility
formats and displays the on-line manual pages.
This version knows
about the
.Ev MANPATH
and
.Ev PAGER
environment variables, so you can have
your own set(s) of personal man pages and choose whatever program you
like to display the formatted pages.
If
.Ar section
is specified,
.Nm
only looks in that section of the manual.
You may also specify the
order to search the sections for entries and which preprocessors to
run on the source files via command line options or environment
variables.
If enabled by the system administrator, formatted man
pages will also be compressed with the
.Dq Li "%compress%"
command to save space.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width ".Fl P Ar pager"
.It Fl M Ar path
Specify an alternate manpath.
By default,
.Nm
uses
.Xr manpath 1
(which is built into the
.Nm
binary)
to determine the path to search.
This option overrides the
.Ev MANPATH
environment variable.
.It Fl P Ar pager
Specify which pager to use.
By default,
.Nm
uses
.Dq Li "%pager%" .
This option overrides the
.Ev PAGER
environment variable.
.It Fl S Ar list
List is a colon separated list of manual sections to search.
This option overrides the
.Ev MANSECT
environment variable.
.It Fl a
By default,
.Nm
will exit after displaying the first manual page it
finds.
Using this option forces
.Nm
to display all the manual pages
that match
.Ar name ,
not just the first.
.It Fl d
Do not actually display the man pages, but do print gobs of debugging
information.
.It Fl f
Equivalent to
.Nm whatis .
.It Fl h
Print a help message and exit.
.It Fl k
Equivalent to
.Nm apropos .
.It Fl m Ar arch Ns Op : Ns Ar machine
As some manual pages are intended only for specific
architectures and machine types,
.Nm
searches any subdirectories,
with the same name as the current machine type and architecture,
in every directory which it searches.
Machine specific areas are checked before architecture specific areas,
and architecture specific areas are checked before general areas.
For example, for
.Dq Li i386:pc98 ,
the following subdirectories will be searched for section 8
manpages, in order:
.Pa man8/pc98, man8/i386 ,
and
.Pa man8 .
.Pp
The current machine type may be overridden using this option
or by setting the environment variable
.Ev MACHINE
to the name of a specific machine.
The current architecture may be overridden using this option
or by setting the environment variable
.Ev MACHINE_ARCH
to the name of a specific architecture.
This option overrides the
.Ev MACHINE
and
.Ev MACHINE_ARCH
environment variables.
A
.Ar machine
component, if omitted, defaults to
.Ar arch .
.It Fl o
Look for original, non-localized manpages only.
.Pp
By default,
.Nm
searches for a localized manpage
in a set of locale subdirectories of each
.Xr manpath 1
component.
.Pp
Locale name is taken from the first of three environment variables
with a nonempty value:
.Ev LC_ALL , LC_CTYPE ,
or
.Ev LANG ,
in the specified order.
.Pp
If the value could not be determined, or is not a valid locale name,
then only non-localized manpage will be looked up.
.Pp
Otherwise,
.Nm
will search in the following subdirectories, in the order of precedence:
.Pp
.Bl -item -offset indent -compact
.Sm off
.It
.Pa <lang> _ <country> . <charset>
.It
.Pa <lang> . <charset>
.It
.Pa en . <charset>
.Sm on
.El
.Pp
For example, for the
.Dq Li de_DE.ISO8859-1
locale,
.Nm
will search in the following subdirectories of the
.Pa /usr/share/man
manpath component:
.Pp
.Bl -item -offset indent -compact
.It
.Pa /usr/share/man/de_DE.ISO8859-1
.It
.Pa /usr/share/man/de.ISO8859-1
.It
.Pa /usr/share/man/en.ISO8859-1
.El
.Pp
Finally,
if the search of localized manpage fails,
it will be looked up in the default
.Pa /usr/share/man
directory.
.It Fl p Ar string
Specify the sequence of preprocessors to run before
.Xr nroff 1
or
.Xr troff 1 .
Not all installations will have a full set of preprocessors.
Some of the preprocessors and the letters used to designate them are:
.Nm eqn Pq e ,
.Nm grap Pq g ,
.Nm pic Pq p ,
.Nm tbl Pq t ,
.Nm vgrind Pq v ,
.Nm refer Pq r .
This option overrides the
.Ev MANROFFSEQ
environment variable.
.It Fl t
Use
.Dq Li "%troff%"
to format the manual page, passing the output to stdout.
The default output format of
.Xr groff 1
is Postscript, but see the manual page of
.Xr groff 1
for ways to pick an alternate format.
.Pp
Depending on the selected format and the availability of printing
devices, the output
may need to be passed through some filter or another before being
printed.
.It Fl w
Do not actually display the man pages, but do print the location(s) of
the files that would be formatted or displayed.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width ".Ev MACHINE_ARCH"
.It Ev LC_ALL , LC_CTYPE , LANG
These variables specify the preferred language for manual pages.
(See the
.Fl o
option above.)
.It Ev MACHINE
If
.Ev MACHINE
is set, its value is used to override the current machine type
when searching machine specific subdirectories.
.It Ev MACHINE_ARCH
If
.Ev MACHINE_ARCH
is set, its value is used to override the current architecture
when searching architecture specific subdirectories.
.It Ev MANPATH
If
.Ev MANPATH
is set, its value is used as the path to search for manual pages.
.It Ev MANROFFSEQ
If
.Ev MANROFFSEQ
is set, its value is used to determine the set of preprocessors run
before running
.Xr nroff 1
or
.Xr troff 1 .
By default, pages are passed through
the table preprocessor
.Pq Xr tbl 1
before
.Xr nroff 1 .
.It Ev MANSECT
If
.Ev MANSECT
is set, its value is used to determine which manual sections to search.
.It Ev PAGER
If
.Ev PAGER
is set, its value is used as the name of the program to use to display
the man page.
By default,
.Dq Li "%pager%"
is used.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Pp
Normally, to look at the relevant manpage information for
.Dq Li getopt ,
one would use:
.Pp
.Dl "man getopt"
.Pp
However, when referring to a specific section of the manual,
such as
.Xr getopt 3 ,
one would use:
.Pp
.Dl "man 3 getopt"

.Sh BUGS
The
.Fl t
option only works if the
.Xr troff 1 Ns -like
program is installed.
