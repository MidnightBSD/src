GNU grep

Original source distribution can be found at:
	http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/grep/

Due to an unfortunate number of bugs and performance problems in
GNU grep 2.5.1, various patches from The Fedora Project have been applied.
These patches can be extracted from the SRPM package available at:

	http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/fedora/linux/core/test/
		3.92/SRPMS/grep-2.5.1-48.src.rpm

The following patches have been applied:

	grep-2.5-i18n.patch
	grep-2.5.1-bracket.patch
	grep-2.5.1-color.patch
	grep-2.5.1-dfa-optional.patch
	grep-2.5.1-egf-speedup.patch
	grep-2.5.1-fgrep.patch
	grep-2.5.1-icolor.patch
	grep-2.5.1-oi.patch
	grep-2.5.1-w.patch

In addition to these, some FreeBSD-specific changes have been made
to add bzip2 support, etc.

Due to the large number of patches applied, conflicts are likely with
future releases. However, most of the patches are either (a) small bug
fixes that have been fed upstream, or (b) performance improvements that
could be reverted without loss of functionality.

It is suggested that those planning to import a newer release of GNU grep
should revert all local changes since the 2.5.1 import before proceeding
with the newer import.
