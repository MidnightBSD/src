.Op Ar filenames | Fl C Ar directory-name
.Ar ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Tar
is short for
.Dq tape archiver ,
so named for historical reasons; the
.Nm
program creates, adds files to, or extracts files from an archive file
in
.Nm
format, called a
.Ar tarfile .
A
.Ar tarfile
is often a magnetic tape, but can be a floppy diskette or any
regular disk file.
.Pp
The first argument word of the
.Nm
command line is usually a command word of bundled function and modifier
letters, optionally preceded by a dash;
it must contain exactly one function letter from the set
.Cm A ,
.Cm c ,
.Cm d ,
.Cm r ,
.Cm t ,
.Cm u ,
.Cm x ,
for
.Em append ,
.Em create ,
.Em difference ,
.Em replace ,
.Em table of contents ,
.Em update ,
and
.Em extract
(further described below).
The command word can also contain other function modifiers described below,
some of which will take arguments from the command line in the order they
are specified in the command word (review the
.Sx EXAMPLES
section).
Functions and function modifiers can also be specified
with the GNU argument convention (preceded by two dashes, one function or
modifier per word.
Command-line arguments that specify files to
add to, extract from, or list from an archive may be given as shell
pattern matching strings.
.Sh FUNCTIONS
Exactly one of the following functions must be specified.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "--concatenate" -compact
.It Fl A
.It Fl -catenate
.It Fl "-concatenate"
Append the contents of named file, which must itself be a
.Nm
archive,
to the end of the archive (erasing the old end-of-archive block).
This has the effect of adding the files contained in the named file to
the first archive, rather than adding the second archive as an element
of the first.
.Em Note :
This option requires a rewritable
.Ar tarfile ,
and therefore does not work on quarter-inch cartridge tapes.
.It Fl c
.It Fl -create
Create a new archive (or truncates an old one) and writes the named files
to it.
.It Fl d
.It Fl -diff
.It Fl -compare
Find differences between files in the archive and corresponding files in
the file system.
.It Fl -delete
Delete named files from the archive.
(Does not work on quarter-inch tapes).
.It Fl r
.It Fl -append
Append files to the end of an archive.
(Does not work on quarter-inch tapes).
.It Fl t
.It Fl -list
List the contents of an archive; if
.Ar filename
arguments are given, only those
files are listed, otherwise the entire table of contents is listed.
.It Fl u
.It Fl -update
Append the named files if the on-disk version has a modification date
more recent than their copy in the archive (if any).
Does not work on quarter-inch tapes.
.It Fl x
.It Fl -extract
.It Fl -get
Extract files from an archive.
The owner, modification time, and file permissions are restored, if possible.
If no
.Ar file
arguments are given, extract all the files in the archive.
If a
.Ar filename
argument matches the name of a directory on the tape, that directory and
its contents are extracted (as well as all directories under that directory).
If the archive contains multiple entries corresponding to the same file
(see the
.Fl -append
command above), the last one extracted will overwrite all earlier versions.
.El
.Sh OPTIONS
The other options to
.Nm
may be combined arbitrarily; single-letter options may be bundled in with
the command word.
Verbose options which take arguments will be
followed by the argument; single-letter options will consume
successive command line arguments (see the
.Sx EXAMPLES
below).
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "--preserve-permissions" -compact
.It Fl -help
Prints a message listing and briefly describing all the command
options to
.Nm .

.It Fl C Ar directory

Print number of buffer reads/writes while reading/writing the archive.
.It Fl f Xo

.Xc
.It Fl -file Xo
.Oo Ar hostname : Oc Ns Ar file
.Xc

.Ar file
(default is
.Pa /dev/sa0 ) .
If a
.Ar hostname
is specified,
.Nm
will use
.Xr rmt 8

.Ar file
on a remote machine.

.Xc

.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The
.Nm
program examines the following environment variables.
.Bl -tag -width "POSIXLY_CORRECT"
.It Ev POSIXLY_CORRECT
Normally,
.Nm
will process flag arguments that appear in the file list.
If set in the environment, this causes
.Nm
to consider the first
non-flag argument to terminate flag processing, as per the POSIX specification.
.It Ev SHELL
In interactive mode, a permissible response to the prompt is to
request to spawn a subshell, which will be
.Pa /bin/sh
unless the
.Ev SHELL
variable is set.
.It Ev TAPE
Changes
.Nm Ns 's
default tape drive (which is still overridden by the
.Fl f
flag).
.It Ev TAR_OPTIONS
The
.Ev TAR_OPTIONS
environment variable
can hold a set of default options for
.Nm .
These options are interpreted first and can be overwritten by explicit command
line parameters.
.It TAR_RSH
The TAR_RSH environment variable allows you to override the default
shell used as the transport for
.Nm .
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/dev/sa0"
.It Pa /dev/sa0
The default tape drive.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
To create an archive on tape drive
.Pa /dev/sa0
with a block size of 20 blocks, containing files named
.Pa bert
and
.Pa ernie ,
you can enter
.Dl "tar cfb /dev/sa0 20 bert ernie"
or
.Dl "tar --create --file /dev/sa0 --block-size 20 bert ernie"
Note that the
.Fl f
and
.Fl b
flags both require arguments, which they take from the command line in
the order they were listed in the command word.
.Pp
Because
.Pa /dev/sa0
is the default device, and 20 is the default block
size, the above example could have simply been
.Dl "tar c bert ernie"
.Pp
To extract all the C sources and headers from an archive named
.Pa backup.tar ,
type
.Dl "tar xf backup.tar '*.[ch]'"
Note that the pattern must be quoted to prevent the shell from
attempting to expand it according the files in the current working
directory (the shell does not have access to the list of files in
the archive, of course).
.Pp
To move file hierarchies, use a command line like this:
.Bd -literal
tar -cf - -C srcdir . | tar xpf - -C destdir
.Ed
.Pp
To create a compressed archive on diskette, using
.Xr gzip 1 ,
use a command-line like
.Dl "tar --block-compress -z -c -v -f /dev/fd1a -b 36 tar/"
.Pp
Note that you cannot mix bundled flags and
.Fl -style
flags; you can use
single-letter flags in the manner above, rather than having to type
.Dl "tar --block-compress --gzip --verbose --file /dev/fd1a --block-size 20 tar/"
.Pp
The above-created diskette can be listed with
.Dl "tar tvfbz /dev/fd1a 36"
.Pp
To join two
.Nm
archives into a single archive, use
.Dl "tar Af archive1.tar archive2.tar"
which will add the files contained in
.Pa archive2.tar
onto the end of
.Pa archive1.tar
(note that this cannot be done by simply typing
.Dl "cat archive2.tar >> archive1.tar"
because of the end-of-file block at the end of a
.Nm
archive).
.Pp
To archive all files from the directory
.Pa srcdir ,
which were modified
after Feb.\& 9th 1997, 13:00 h, use
.Dl "tar -c -f backup.tar --newer-mtime 'Feb 9 13:15 1997' srcdir/"
.Pp
Other possible time specifications are
.Sq "02/09/97 13:15" ,
.Sq "1997-02-09 13:15" ,
.Sq "13:15 9 Feb 1997" ,
.Sq "9 Feb 1997 13:15" ,
.Sq "Feb. 9, 1997 1:15pm" ,
.Sq "09-Feb" ,
.Sq "3 weeks ago"
or
.Sq "May first Sunday" .
To specify the correct time zone use either e.g.\&
.Sq "13:15 CEST"
or
.Sq "13:15+200" .
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
The
.Fl y
is a
.Fx
localism.
The GNU
.Nm
maintainer has now chosen
.Fl j
as the offical
.Xr bzip2 1
compression option in GNU
.Nm
1.13.18 and later.
The
.Fl I
option is for compatibility with Solaris's
.Nm .

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
format has a rich history, dating back to Sixth Edition
.Ux .
The current implementation of
.Nm
is the GNU implementation, which
originated as the public-domain
.Nm
written by
.An John Gilmore .

group from the
.Nx 1.0
release.
.Sh BUGS
The
.Fl C
feature does not work like historical
.Nm
programs, and is probably untrustworthy.
.Pp
The
.Fl A
command should work to join an arbitrary number of
.Nm
archives
together, but it does not; attempting to do so leaves the
end-of-archive blocks in place for the second and subsequent archives.
.Pp
The
.Nm
file format is a semi fixed width field format, and the field
for device numbers were designed for 16 bit (8 major, 8 minor)
and cannot absorb our 32 bit (8 major, 16+8 minor) numbers.
