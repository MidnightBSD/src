.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm unzip
.Nd extract files from a ZIP archive
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl ajLlnoqtu
.Op Fl d Ar dir
.Ar zipfile
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.\" ...
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl a
When extracting a text file, convert DOS-style line endings to
Unix-style line endings.
.It Fl d Ar dir
Extract files into the specified directory rather than the current
directory.
.It Fl j
Ignore directories stored in the zipfile; instead, extract all files
directly into the extraction directory.
.It Fl L
Convert the names of the extracted files and directories to lowercase.
.It Fl l
List, rather than extract, the contents of the zipfile.
.It Fl n
No overwrite.
When extacting a file from the zipfile, if a file with the same name
already exists on disk, the file is silently skipped.
.It Fl o
Overwrite.
When extacting a file from the zipfile, if a file with the same name
already exists on disk, the existing file is replaced with the file
from the zipfile.
.It Fl q
Quiet: print less information while extracting.
.It Fl t
Test: do not extract anything, but verify the checksum of every file
in the archive.
.It Fl u
Update.
When extacting a file from the zipfile, if a file with the same name
already exists on disk, the existing file is replaced with the file
from the zipfile if and only if the latter is newer than the former.
Otherwise, the file is silently skipped.
.El
.Pp
Note that only one of
.Fl n ,
.Fl o
and
.Fl u
may be specified.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
If the
.Ev UNZIP_DEBUG
environment variable is defined, the
.Fl q
command-line option has no effect, and additional debugging
information will be printed to
.Va stderr .
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
The
.Nm
utility aims to be sufficiently compatible with other implementations
to serve as a drop-in replacement in the context of the
.Xr ports 7
system.
No attempt has been made to replicate functionality which is not
required for that purpose.
.Pp
For compatibility reasons, command-line options will be recognized if
they are listed not only before but also after the name of the
zipfile.
.Pp
Normally, the
.Fl a
option should only affect files which are marked as text files in the
zipfile's central directory.
Since the
.Xr archive 3
library reads zipfiles sequentially, and does not use the central
directory, that information is not available to the
.Nm
utility.
Instead, the
.Nm
utility will assume that a file is a text file if no non-ASCII
characters are present within the first block of data decompressed for
that file.
If non-ASCII characters appear in subsequent blocks of data, a warning
will be issued.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility is only able to process ZIP archives handled by
.Xr libarchive 3 .
Depending on the installed version of
.Xr libarchive ,
this may or may not include self-extracting archives.
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
utility currently does not support asking the user whether to
overwrite or skip a file that already exists on disk.
To be on the safe side, it will fail if it encounters a file that
already exists and neither the
.Fl n
nor the
.Fl o
command line option was specified.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr libarchive 3
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility appeared in
.Fx 8.0 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
utility and this manual page were written by
.An Dag-Erling Sm\(/orgrav Aq des@FreeBSD.org .
It uses the
.Xr archive 3
library developed by
.An Tim Kientzle Aq kientzle@FreeBSD.org .
