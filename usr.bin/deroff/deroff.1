.Sh NAME
.Nm deroff
.Nd remove nroff/troff, eqn, pic and tbl constructs
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm deroff
.Op Fl ikpw
.Oo
.Fl m
.Ar a | e | l | m | s
.Oc
.Op Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm deroff
reads each file in sequence and removes all
.Xr nroff 1
and
.Xr troff 1
command lines, backslash constructions, macro definitions,
.Xr eqn 1
constructs (between
.Dq .EQ
and
.Dq .EN
lines or between delimiters),
.Xr pic 1
pictures,
and table descriptions and writes the remainder to the standard output.
.Nm
follows chains of included files
.Po
.Dq .so
and
.Dq .nx
commands
.Pc ;
if a file has already been included, a
.Dq .so
is ignored and a
.Dq .nx
terminates execution.
If no input file is given,
.Nm
reads from the standard input.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl i
Ignore
.Dq .so
and
.Dq .nx
commands.
.It Fl k
Keep blocks of text intact.
This is the default behavior unless the
.Fl m
option is given.
.It Fl m
Enable support for common macro packages.
The
.Fl m
option takes the following arguments:
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It a
recognize
.Xr man 7
macros.
.It e
recognize
.Xr me 7
macros.
.It l
remove list constructs.
.It m
recognize
.Xr mm 7
macros.
.It s
recognize
.Xr ms 7
macros.
.El
.It Fl p
Preserve paragraph macros.
This option only has an effect if the
.Fl m
option is also specified.
.It Fl w
Output a word list, one
.Sq word
(string of letters, digits, and apostrophes, beginning with a
letter; apostrophes are removed) per line, and all other characters
ignored.
Normally, the output follows the original, with the deletions
mentioned above.

.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr eqn 1 ,
.Xr nroff 1 ,
.Xr pic 1 ,
.Xr tbl 1 ,
.Xr troff 1
.Sh HISTORY
.Nm
appeared in
.At v7 .
.Sh BUGS
.Nm
is not a complete
.Xr troff 1
interpreter, so it can be confused by subtle constructs.
Most errors result in too much rather than too little output.
.Pp
The
.Fl ml
option does not correctly handle nested lists.
