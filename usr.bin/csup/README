CVSup was originally written in Modula-3 by
	John Polstra <jdp@polstra.com>.

Csup is a rewrite of CVSup in C.  It has been mostly written by
	Maxime Henrion <mux@FreeBSD.org>.

A few contributors have helped him in his task and they are listed here in
alphabetical order :

	Olivier Houchard <cognet@FreeBSD.org>
	Ulf Lilleengen <lulf@kerneled.org>
	Christoph Mathys <cmathys@bluewin.ch>	(Google SoC Project)
	Etienne Vidal <etienne.vidal@gmail.com>


Building & Installing
---------------------

Csup should build and run fine under any *BSD OS (that includes FreeBSD,
NetBSD, OpenBSD and DragonFlyBSD), as well as Linux and Darwin.  If you
have a problem building from source, drop me a mail!

There is one Makefile specifically tailored for *BSD systems named
Makefile and another one that is gmake-specific for Darwin and Linux
users named GNUmakefile.  You don't really need to worry about that
since whatever your "make" command is, it should pick up the correct
Makefile.

As usual, to build the source code, just run "make".  Once this is done,
just run "make install" to install the binary and manual page.

Be warned however that if the packaging system of your OS knows about
csup, it is certainly better to install it from there rather than by
hand, so that it can then be properly deinstalled.
