 * South African holidays
 * Note:  The Public Holidays Act (Act No 36 of 1994) determines whenever
 * any public holiday falls on a Sunday, the Monday following on it shall
 * be an unnamed public holiday in addition to the named holiday the day
 * before. This file format is not complex enough to reflect this, but
 * if it ever is, the change should be made.
