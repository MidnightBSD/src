.Sh NAME
.Nm doas
.Nd execute commands as another user
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm doas
.Op Fl nSs
.Op Fl a Ar style
.Op Fl C Ar config
.Op Fl u Ar user
.Op Fl -
.Ar command
.Op Ar args
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility executes the given command as another user.
The
.Ar command
argument is mandatory unless
.Fl C ,
.Fl S ,
or
.Fl s
is specified.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width tenletters
.It Fl a Ar style
Use the specified authentication style when validating the user,
as allowed by
.Pa /etc/login.conf .
A list of doas-specific authentication methods may be configured by adding an
.Sq auth-doas
entry in
.Xr login.conf 5 .
.It Fl C Ar config
Parse and check the configuration file
.Ar config ,
then exit.
If
.Ar command
is supplied,
.Nm
will also perform command matching.
In the latter case
either
.Sq permit ,
.Sq permit nopass
or
.Sq deny
will be printed on standard output, depending on command
matching results.
No command is executed.
.It Fl n
Non interactive mode, fail if
.Nm
would prompt for password.
.It Fl S
Same as
.Fl s
but simulates a full login. Please note this may result in doas applying resource limits
to the user based on the target user's login class. However, environment variables
applicable to the target user are still stripped, unless KEEPENV is specified.
.It Fl s
Execute the shell from
.Ev SHELL
or
.Pa /etc/passwd .
.It Fl u Ar user
Execute the command as
.Ar user .
The default is root.
Please note: On some systems multiple usernames can resolve to one UID. For example, root and
toor both resolve to UID 0 on FreeBSD. Please see the "as" syntax section of the doas.conf manual page for details on
how doas handles this situation.
.It Fl -
Any dashes after a combined double dash (--) will be interpreted as part of the command to be run or its parameters. Not an argument passed to doas itself.
