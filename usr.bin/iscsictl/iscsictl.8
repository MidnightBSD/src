.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is used to configure the iSCSI initiator.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width ".Fl A"
.It Fl A
Add session.
.It Fl R
Remove session.
.It Fl L
List sessions.
.It Fl a
When adding, add all sessions defined in the configuration file.
When removing, remove all currently established sessions.
.It Fl c
Path to the configuration file.
The default is
.Pa /etc/iscsi.conf .
.It Fl d
Target host name or address used for SendTargets discovery.
When used, it will add a temporary discovery session.
After discovery is done, sessions will be added for each discovered target,
and the temporary discovery sesion will be removed.
.It Fl n
The "nickname" of session defined in the configuration file.
.It Fl p
Target portal - host name or address - for statically defined targets.
.It Fl t
Target name.
.It Fl v
Verbose mode.
.El
.Pp
Since connecting to the target is performed in background, non-zero
exit status does not mean that the session was successfully established.
Use
.Nm Fl L
to check the connection status.
The initiator notifies
.Xr devd 8
when session gets connected or disconnected.
.Pp
Note that in order to the iSCSI initiator to be able to connect to a target,
the
.Xr iscsid 8
daemon must be running.
.Pp
Also note that
.Fx
currently supports two different initiators: the old one,
.Xr iscsi_initiator 4 ,
with its control utility
.Xr iscontrol 8 ,
and the new one,
.Xr iscsi 4 ,
with
.Nm
and
.Xr iscsid 8 .
The only thing the two have in common is the configuration file,
.Xr iscsi.conf 5 .
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width ".Pa /etc/iscsi.conf" -compact
.It Pa /etc/iscsi.conf
iSCSI initiator configuration file.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
