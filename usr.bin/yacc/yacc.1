.Sh NAME
.Nm yacc
.Nd an LALR(1) parser generator
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl dlrtvy
.Op Fl b Ar file_prefix
.Op Fl o Ar output_filename
.Op Fl p Ar symbol_prefix
.Ar filename
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility reads the grammar specification in the file
.Ar filename
and generates an LR(1) parser for it.
The parsers consist of a set of LALR(1) parsing tables and a driver routine
written in the C programming language.
The
.Nm
utility normally writes the parse tables and the driver routine to the file
.Pa y.tab.c .
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl b Ar file_prefix
Change the prefix prepended to the output file names to
the string denoted by
.Ar file_prefix .
The default prefix is the character
.Pa y .
.It Fl d
Cause the header file
.Pa y.tab.h
to be written.
.It Fl l
If the
.Fl l
option is not specified,
.Nm
will insert #line directives in the generated code.
The #line directives let the C compiler relate errors in the
generated code to the user's original code.
If the
.Fl l
option is specified,
.Nm
will not insert the #line directives.
Any #line directives specified by the user will be retained.
.It Fl o Ar output_filename
Cause
.Nm
to write the generated code to
.Ar output_filename
instead of the default file,
.Pa y.tab.c .
.It Fl p Ar symbol_prefix
Change the prefix prepended to yacc-generated symbols to
the string denoted by
.Ar symbol_prefix .
The default prefix is the string
.Pa yy .
.It Fl r
Cause
.Nm
to produce separate files for code and tables.
The code file
is named
.Pa y.code.c ,
and the tables file is named
.Pa y.tab.c .
.It Fl t
Change the preprocessor directives generated by
.Nm
so that debugging statements will be incorporated in the compiled code.
.It Fl v
Cause a human-readable description of the generated parser to
be written to the file
.Pa y.output .
.It Fl y
NOOP for bison compatibility.
.Nm
is already designed to be POSIX yacc compatible.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width ".Ev TMPDIR"
.It Ev TMPDIR
Name of directory where temporary files are to be created.
.El
.Sh TABLES
The names of the tables generated by this version of
.Nm
are
.Va yylhs , yylen , yydefred , yydgoto , yysindex ,
.Va yyrindex , yygindex , yytable ,
and
.Va yycheck .
Two additional tables,
.Va yyname
and
.Va yyrule ,
are created if
.Dv YYDEBUG
is defined and non-zero.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "Pa /tmp/yacc.aXXXXXXXXXX" -compact
.It Pa y.code.c
.It Pa y.tab.c
.It Pa y.tab.h
.It Pa y.output
.It Pa /tmp/yacc.aXXXXXXXXXX
.It Pa /tmp/yacc.tXXXXXXXXXX
.It Pa /tmp/yacc.uXXXXXXXXXX
.El
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
If there are rules that are never reduced,
the number of such rules is reported on standard error.
If there are any
.Tn LALR(1)
conflicts,
the number of conflicts is reported on standard error.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr yyfix 1
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
utility conforms to
.St -p1003.2 .
.Sh HISTORY
A
.Nm
command appeared in PWB UNIX.
