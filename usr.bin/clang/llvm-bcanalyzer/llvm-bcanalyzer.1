.SH "NAME"
llvm\-bcanalyzer \- LLVM bitcode analyzer
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
\&\fBllvm-bcanalyzer\fR [\fIoptions\fR] [\fIfilename\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The \fBllvm-bcanalyzer\fR command is a small utility for analyzing bitcode files.
The tool reads a bitcode file (such as generated with the \fBllvm-as\fR tool) and
produces a statistical report on the contents of the bitcode file.  The tool
can also dump a low level but human readable version of the bitcode file. 
This tool is probably not of much interest or utility except for those working 
directly with the bitcode file format. Most \s-1LLVM\s0 users can just ignore
this tool.
.PP
If \fIfilename\fR is omitted or is \f(CW\*(C`\-\*(C'\fR, then \fBllvm-bcanalyzer\fR reads its input 
from standard input. This is useful for combining the tool into a pipeline.
Output is written to the standard output.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB\-nodetails\fR" 4
.IX Item "-nodetails"
Causes \fBllvm-bcanalyzer\fR to abbreviate its output by writing out only a module 
level summary. The details for individual functions are not displayed.
.IP "\fB\-dump\fR" 4
.IX Item "-dump"
Causes \fBllvm-bcanalyzer\fR to dump the bitcode in a human readable format. This 
format is significantly different from \s-1LLVM\s0 assembly and provides details about 
the encoding of the bitcode file.
.IP "\fB\-verify\fR" 4
.IX Item "-verify"
Causes \fBllvm-bcanalyzer\fR to verify the module produced by reading the 
bitcode. This ensures that the statistics generated are based on a consistent
module.
.IP "\fB\-help\fR" 4
.IX Item "-help"
Print a summary of command line options.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
.IX Header "EXIT STATUS"
If \fBllvm-bcanalyzer\fR succeeds, it will exit with 0.  Otherwise, if an error
occurs, it will exit with a non-zero value, usually 1.
