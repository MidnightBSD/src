hw_flow_control (boolean) capability added to modem configuration
data base (/etc/modems).

Configurable unidialer driver compiled in by default. Builtin
ACU drivers no longer compiled in by default.

All configuration details isolated in tipconf.h (with exception of 
pathnames.h).

Made corrections to and updated manual page for tip.

Conditional compilation of cu interface for systems that provide
a separate cu implementation (e.g. FreeBSD).

Corrected entry in man file to identify the lockfile dir as /var/spool/locks
instead of /var/spool/uucp.

xfer and transfer in cmds.c use standard C runtime buffered output.
Eliminates a bug: buffer overruns when FRAMESIZE > BUFSIZ.

Added xfer routine for doing cu style take commands.

Added support for termios.

Renamed acunap.* to acucommon.*. Moved common acu routines
to it. Modified acu drivers to use common routines.

Default nap function uses select call in preference to
usleep or old, handrolled code.

tip makefile does not create a link to cu by default.

Reduced sleep time in finish () in cmds.c from 5 seconds to two.

Added table-driven modem driver (unidialer) that fetches modem
characteristics from a modem database ("/etc/modems").

Removed common "nap" code from individual ACU drivers into a
separate module.

Added login script capability to remote database.

Use HoneyDanber style locks by default (ASCII PIDs written to lock files).

Changed default uucp file lock directory to "/var/spool/locks"
to be consistent with default build of Taylor uucp.

Reorganized build environment for tip into a master directory
and two subdirectories. The master Makefile builds a library
of ACU "drivers" in the directory libacu. Tip only links in
drivers that it will actually use.
