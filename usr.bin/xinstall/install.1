.Ar directory ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The file(s) are copied
to the target file or directory.
If the destination is a directory, then the
.Ar file
is copied into
.Ar directory
with its original filename.
If the target file already exists, it is
either renamed to
.Ar file Ns Pa .old
if the
.Fl b
option is given
or overwritten
if permissions allow.
An alternate backup suffix may be specified via the
.Fl B
option's argument.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl b
Back up any existing files before overwriting them by renaming
them to
.Ar file Ns Pa .old .
See
.Fl B
for specifying a different backup suffix.
.It Fl B Ar suffix
Use
.Ar suffix
as the backup suffix if
.Fl b
is given.
.It Fl C
Copy the file.
If the target file already exists and the files are the same,
then do not change the modification time of the target.
If the target's file flags and mode need not to be changed,
the target's inode change time is also unchanged.
.It Fl c
Copy the file.
This is actually the default.
The
.Fl c
option is only included for backwards compatibility.
.It Fl d
Create directories.
Missing parent directories are created as required.
.It Fl f
Specify the target's file flags; see
.Xr chflags 1
for a list of possible flags and their meanings.
.It Fl g
Specify a group.
A numeric GID is allowed.
.It Fl M
Disable all use of
.Xr mmap 2 .
.It Fl m
Specify an alternate mode.
The default mode is set to rwxr-xr-x (0755).
The specified mode may be either an octal or symbolic value; see
.Xr chmod 1
for a description of possible mode values.
.It Fl o
Specify an owner.
A numeric UID is allowed.
.It Fl p
Preserve the access and modification times.
Copy the file, as if the
.Fl C
(compare and copy) option is specified,
except if the target file does not already exist or is different,
then preserve the access and modification times of the source file.
.It Fl S
Safe copy.
Normally,
.Nm
unlinks an existing target before installing the new file.
With the
.Fl S
flag a temporary file is used and then renamed to be
the target.
The reason this is safer is that if the copy or
rename fails, the existing target is left untouched.
.It Fl s
.Nm
exec's the command
.Xr strip 1
to strip binaries so that
.Nm
can be portable over a large
number of systems and binary types.
See below for how
.Nm
can be instructed to use another program to strip binaries.
.It Fl v
Cause
.Nm
to be verbose,
showing files as they are installed or backed up.
.El
.Pp
By default,
.Nm
preserves all file flags, with the exception of the
.Dq nodump
flag.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility attempts to prevent moving a file onto itself.
.Pp
Installing
.Pa /dev/null
creates an empty file.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The
.Nm
utility checks for the presence of the
.Ev STRIPBIN
environment variable and if present,
uses the assigned value as the program to run if and when the
.Fl s
option has been specified.
.Pp
If the
.Ev DONTSTRIP
environment variable is present,
.Nm
will ignore any specification of the
.Fl s
option.
This is mainly for use in debugging the
.Fx
Ports Collection.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width ".Pa INS@XXXX" -compact
.It Pa INS@XXXX
If either
.Fl S
option is specified, or the
.Fl C
or
.Fl p
option is used in conjunction with the
.Fl s
option, temporary files named
.Pa INS@XXXX ,
where
.Pa XXXX
is decided by
.Xr mkstemp 3 ,
are created in the target directory.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
Historically
.Nm
moved files by default.
The default was changed to copy in
.Fx 4.4 .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr chflags 1 ,
.Xr chgrp 1 ,
.Xr chmod 1 ,
.Xr cp 1 ,
.Xr mv 1 ,
.Xr strip 1 ,
.Xr mmap 2 ,
.Xr chown 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility appeared in
.Bx 4.2 .
.Sh BUGS
Temporary files may be left in the target directory if
.Nm
exits abnormally.
.Pp
File flags cannot be set by
.Xr fchflags 2
over a NFS file system.
Other file systems do not have a concept of flags.
The
.Nm
utility will only warn when flags could not be set on a file system
that does not support them.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility with
.Fl v
falsely says a file is copied when
.Fl C
snaps hard links.
