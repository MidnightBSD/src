.Sh NAME
.Nm quota
.Nd display disk usage and limits
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl glu
.Op Fl v | Fl q
.Nm
.Op Fl lu
.Op Fl v | Fl q
.Ar user ...
.Nm
.Fl g
.Op Fl l
.Op Fl v | Fl q
.Ar group ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility displays users' disk usage and limits.
By default only the user quotas are printed.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl g
Print group quotas for the group
of which the user is a member.
.It Fl l
Do not report quotas on
.Tn NFS
file systems.
.It Fl q
Print a more terse message,
containing only information
on file systems where usage is over quota.
.It Fl u
Print the user quotas.
This is the default unless
.Fl g
is specified.
.It Fl v
Display quotas on file systems
where no storage is allocated.
.El
.Pp
Specifying both
.Fl g
and
.Fl u
displays both the user quotas and the group quotas (for
the user).
.Pp
Only the super-user may use the
.Fl u
flag and the optional
.Ar user
argument to view the limits of other users.
Non-super-users can use the
.Fl g
flag and optional
.Ar group
argument to view only the limits of groups of which they are members.
.Pp
The
.Fl q
flag takes precedence over the
.Fl v
flag.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility tries to report the quotas of all mounted file systems.
If the file system is mounted via
.Tn NFS ,
it will attempt to contact the
.Xr rpc.rquotad 8
daemon on the
.Tn NFS
server.
For
.Tn UFS
file systems, quotas must be turned on in
.Pa /etc/fstab .
If
.Nm
exits with a non-zero status, one or more file systems
are over quota.
.Pp
If the
.Fl l
flag is specified,
.Nm
will not check
.Tn NFS
file systems.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width quota.group -compact
.It Pa quota.user
located at the file system root with user quotas
.It Pa quota.group
located at the file system root with group quotas
.It Pa /etc/fstab
to find file system names and locations
