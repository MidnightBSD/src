.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm

.Op Fl c
.Op Fl h | k | m
.Op Fl n

.Op Fl I Ar mask
.Op Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility displays the file system block usage for each file argument
and for each directory in the file hierarchy rooted in each directory
argument.
If no file is specified, the block usage of the hierarchy rooted in
the current directory is displayed.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl H
Symbolic links on the command line are followed, symbolic links in file
hierarchies are not followed.
.It Fl L
Symbolic links on the command line and in file hierarchies are followed.
.It Fl I Ar mask
Ignore files and directories matching the specified
.Ar mask .
.It Fl P
No symbolic links are followed.
This is the default.
.It Fl a
Display an entry for each file in a file hierarchy.
.It Fl h
"Human-readable" output.
Use unit suffixes: Byte, Kilobyte, Megabyte,
Gigabyte, Terabyte and Petabyte.
.It Fl r
Generate messages about directories that cannot be read, files
that cannot be opened, and so on.
This is the default case.
This option exists solely for conformance with
.St -xpg4 .
.It Fl s
Display an entry for each specified file.
(Equivalent to
.Fl d Li 0 )
.It Fl d Ar depth
Display an entry for all files and directories
.Ar depth
directories deep.
.It Fl c
Display a grand total.
.It Fl k
Display block counts in 1024-byte (1-Kbyte) blocks.
.It Fl m
Display block counts in 1048576-byte (1-Mbyte) blocks.
.It Fl n
Ignore files and directories with user
.Dq nodump
flag
.Pq Dv UF_NODUMP
set.
.It Fl x
File system mount points are not traversed.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility counts the storage used by symbolic links and not the files they
reference unless the
.Fl H
or
.Fl L
option is specified.
If either the
.Fl H
or
.Fl L
options are specified, storage used by any symbolic links which are
followed is not counted or displayed.
.Pp
Files having multiple hard links are counted (and displayed) a single
time per
.Nm
execution.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width BLOCKSIZE
.It Ev BLOCKSIZE
If the environment variable
.Ev BLOCKSIZE
is set, and the
.Fl k
option is not specified, the block counts will be displayed in units of that
size block.
If
.Ev BLOCKSIZE
is not set, and the
.Fl k
option is not specified, the block counts will be displayed in 512-byte blocks.
