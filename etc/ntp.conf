# Default NTP servers for the FreeBSD operating system.
#
# Don't forget to enable ntpd in /etc/rc.conf with:
# ntpd_enable="YES"
#
# The driftfile is by default /var/db/ntpd.drift, check
# /etc/defaults/rc.conf on how to change the location.
#

#
# The following three servers will give you a random set of three
# NTP servers geographically close to you.
# See http://www.pool.ntp.org/ for details. Note, the pool encourages
# users with a static IP and good upstream NTP servers to add a server
# to the pool. See http://www.pool.ntp.org/join.html if you are interested.
#
# The option `iburst' is used for faster initial synchronisation.

# If you want to pick yourself which country's public NTP server
# you want sync against, comment out the above servers, uncomment
# the next ones and replace CC with the country's abbreviation.
# Make sure that the hostnames resolve to a proper IP address!

# Security: Only accept NTP traffic from the following hosts.
# The following configuration example only accepts traffic from the
# above defined servers.
#
# Please note that this example doesn't work for the servers in
# the pool.ntp.org domain since they return multiple A records.
# (This is the reason that by default they are commented out)

#
# If a server loses sync with all upstream servers, NTP clients
# no longer follow that server. The local clock can be configured
# to provide a time source when this happens, but it should usually
# be configured on just one server on a network. For more details see
# http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Support/UndisciplinedLocalClock
# The use of Orphan Mode may be preferable.
