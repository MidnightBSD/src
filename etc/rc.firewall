#   open        - will allow anyone in
#   client      - will try to protect just this machine
#   simple      - will try to protect a whole network
#   closed      - totally disables IP services except via lo0 interface
#   workstation - will try to protect just this machine using statefull
#		  firewalling. See below for rc.conf variables used
#   UNKNOWN     - disables the loading of firewall rules.
#   filename    - will load the rules in the given filename (full path required)
#
# For ``client'' and ``simple'' the entries below should be customized
