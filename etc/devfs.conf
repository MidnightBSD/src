# These are examples of how to configure devices using /etc/rc.d/devfs.
# The first parameter is always the action to take, the second is always the
# existing device created by devfs, and the last is what you want to change.
# The name of the action is only significant to the first unique character.
#
# Examples:

# Historically X depended on this, but version 4.3.0 doesn't seem to anymore
#link	ttyv0	vga

# Commonly used by many ports
#link	acd0	cdrom
link	cd0	cdrom
link	cd0	dvd

# Allow a user in the wheel group to query the smb0 device
#perm	smb0	0660

# Allow members of group operator to cat things to the speaker
#own	speaker	root:operator
#perm	speaker	0660

# Allow all users to access CD-ROMs
perm 	/dev/acd0	0666
perm	/dev/acd1	0666
perm	/dev/cd0	0666
perm	/dev/cd1	0666

# Allow all USB devices to be mounted.
perm	/dev/da0	0666
perm	/dev/da1	0666
perm	/dev/da2	0666

# Misc devices
perm	/dev/pass0	0666
perm	/dev/xpt0	0666
perm	/dev/agpart	0666
perm	/dev/uscanner0	0666
