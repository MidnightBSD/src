#	This script may be configured to be called by isdnd when an
#	unknown incoming call is received. In case the destination
#	telephone number is available, it sends mail with the time,
#	source and destination numbers to a configurable address.
#
#	For this to work, and entry like this:
#
#		regexpr	= "<unknown> incoming call from"
#		regprog	= unknown_incoming
#
#	is needed in the system section of /etc/isdn/isdnd.rc.
#
#	This script has to be configured to the sites needs, look
#	for the comment lines start with "configure:"
