# Example disklabel for ad0s1.  Once initialized via the instructions in
# the README you can edit the label and create partitions for your 
# filesystems.  The top of the disklabel should already contain reasonable
# values so you should only have to edit the bottom part.  Here is an example
#

8 partitions:
#        size   offset    fstype   [fsize bsize bps/cpg]
  a:   256m        0    4.2BSD     1024  8192	99
  b:  1024m	   *      swap              
  c: <leave this line untouched>
  d:   256m	   *    4.2BSD     1024  8192	99
  e:   256m	   *    4.2BSD     1024  8192	99
  f:  8192m	   *    4.2BSD     2048 16384	99
  g:	*	   *    4.2BSD     2048 16384	99

# The disklabel program accepts 'm' for megabytes, and '*' to auto-fill-in
# the offset.  A '*' in the size field means 'the rest of the disk'.
# disklabel may get confused due to there being too many '*'s in which case
# just remove the g: partition, generate the disklabel, then edit it again
# and g back in.
#
# ad0s1a:	/
# ad0s1b:	swap	(suggest no less then 256m and at least 1xmain-memory)
# ad0s1c:	(represents the whole-disk, generally leave this one alone)
# ad0s1d:	/var
# ad0s1e:	/tmp
# ad0s1f:	/usr	(suggest no less then 4096m but 1024m ok in a crunch)
# ad0s1g:	/home	(all remaining disk space)
# ad0s1h:	(unused)
