       MMaaiillqq prints a summary of the mail messages queued for future delivery.

       The first line printed for each message shows the  internal  identifier
       used on this host for the message with a possible status character, the
       size of the message in  bytes,  the  date  and  time  the  message  was
       accepted  into  the queue, and the envelope sender of the message.  The
       second line shows the error message that  caused  this  message  to  be
       retained  in  the queue; it will not be present if the message is being
       processed for the first time.  The status characters are  either  **  to
       indicate the job is being processed; XX to indicate that the load is too
       high to process the job; and -- to indicate that the job is too young to
       process.  The following lines show message recipients, one per line.

       MMaaiillqq is identical to ``sendmail -bp''.

       The relevant options are as follows:

       --AAcc    Show  the mail submission queue specified in _/_e_t_c_/_m_a_i_l_/_s_u_b_m_i_t_._c_f
              instead of the MTA queue specified in _/_e_t_c_/_m_a_i_l_/_s_e_n_d_m_a_i_l_._c_f.

       --qqLL    Show the "lost" items in the mail queue instead  of  the  normal
              queue items.

       --qqQQ    Show the quarantined items in the mail queue instead of the nor-
              mal queue items.

       --qq[_!]I substr
              Limit processed jobs to those containing _s_u_b_s_t_r as  a  substring
              of the queue id or not when _!  is specified.

       --qq[_!]Q substr
              Limit  processed jobs to quarantined jobs containing _s_u_b_s_t_r as a
              substring of the quarantine reason or not when _!  is  specified.

       --qq[_!]R substr
              Limit  processed  jobs to those containing _s_u_b_s_t_r as a substring
              of one of the recipients or not when _!  is specified.

       --qq[_!]S substr
              Limit processed jobs to those containing _s_u_b_s_t_r as  a  substring
              of the sender or not when _!  is specified.

       --vv     Print  verbose  information.  This adds the priority of the mes-
              sage and a single character indicator (``+'' or blank)  indicat-
              ing whether a warning message has been sent on the first line of
              the message.  Additionally, extra lines may be  intermixed  with
              the  recipients indicating the ``controlling user'' information;
              this shows who will own any programs that are executed on behalf
              of  this message and the name of the alias this command expanded
              from, if any.  Moreover, status messages for each recipient  are
              printed if available.

       Several  sendmail.cf  options influence the behavior of the mmaaiillqq util-
       ity: The number of items printed  per  queue  group  is  restricted  by
       MMaaxxQQuueeuueeRRuunnSSiizzee  if  that  value is set.  The status character ** is not
       printed for some values of QQuueeuueeSSoorrttOOrrddeerr,, e.g., filename, random, mod-
       ification,  and none, unless a --qq option is used to limit the processed
       jobs.

       The mmaaiillqq utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
