       This file describes user ID aliases used by sendmail.  The file resides
       in /etc/mail and is formatted as a series of lines of the form

              name: addr_1, addr_2, addr_3, . . .

       The _n_a_m_e is the name to alias, and the _a_d_d_r___n are the aliases for  that
       name.  _a_d_d_r___n can be another alias, a local username, a local filename,
       a command, an include file, or an external address.

       LLooccaall UUsseerrnnaammee
              username

              The username must be available via getpwnam(3).

       LLooccaall FFiilleennaammee
              /path/name

              Messages are appended to the file specified by the full pathname
              (starting with a slash (/))

       CCoommmmaanndd
              |command

              A  command  starts  with a pipe symbol (|), it receives messages
              via standard input.

       IInncclluuddee FFiillee
              :include: /path/name

              The aliases in pathname are added to the aliases for _n_a_m_e_.

       EE--MMaaiill AAddddrreessss
              user@domain

              An e-mail address in RFC 822 format.

       Lines beginning with white space are continuation lines.   Another  way
       to  continue lines is by placing a backslash directly before a newline.
       Lines beginning with # are comments.

       Aliasing occurs only on local names.  Loops can  not  occur,  since  no
       message will be sent to any person more than once.

       If  an  alias  is found for _n_a_m_e, sendmail then checks for an alias for
       _o_w_n_e_r_-_n_a_m_e.  If it is found and the result of the lookup expands  to  a
       single address, the envelope sender address of the message is rewritten
       to that address.  If it is found and the result expands  to  more  than
       one address, the envelope sender address is changed to _o_w_n_e_r_-_n_a_m_e.

       After  aliasing  has  been  done, local and valid recipients who have a
       ``.forward'' file in their home directory have  messages  forwarded  to
       the list of users defined in that file.

       This  is  only  the  raw  data file; the actual aliasing information is
       placed into a binary format in the file /etc/mail/aliases.db using  the
       program  newaliases(1).   A  newaliases command should be executed each
       time the aliases file is changed for the change to take effect.

BBUUGGSS
       If you have compiled sendmail with DBM support instead  of  NEWDB,  you
       may  have  encountered problems in dbm(3) restricting a single alias to
       about 1000 bytes  of  information.   You  can  get  longer  aliases  by
       ``chaining'';  that is, make the last name in the alias be a dummy name
       which is a continuation alias.
