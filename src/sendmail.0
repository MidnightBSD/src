[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mSendmail [22msends a message to one or more [4mrecipients,[24m routing the message
       over whatever networks are necessary.  [1mSendmail [22mdoes internetwork  for-
       warding as necessary to deliver the message to the correct place.

       [1mSendmail  [22mis  not  intended as a user interface routine; other programs
       provide user-friendly front ends; [1msendmail [22mis used only to deliver pre-
       formatted messages.

       With  no  flags, [1msendmail [22mreads its standard input up to an end-of-file
       or a line consisting only of a single dot and sends a copy of the  mes-
       sage  found  there  to  all of the addresses listed.  It determines the
       network(s) to use based on the syntax and contents of the addresses.

       Local addresses are looked up in  a  file  and  aliased  appropriately.
       Aliasing  can  be  prevented by preceding the address with a backslash.
       Beginning with 8.10, the sender is included in  any  alias  expansions,
       e.g.,  if  `john'  sends to `group', and `group' includes `john' in the
       expansion, then the letter will also be delivered to `john'.

   [1mParameters[0m
       [1m-Ac    [22mUse submit.cf even if the operation mode does  not  indicate  an
              initial mail submission.

       [1m-Am    [22mUse  sendmail.cf even if the operation mode indicates an initial
              mail submission.

       [1m-B[4m[22mtype[24m Set the body type to [4mtype[24m.  Current legal  values  are  7BIT  or
              8BITMIME.

       [1m-ba    [22mGo  into  ARPANET  mode.  All input lines must end with a CR-LF,
              and all messages will be generated with  a  CR-LF  at  the  end.
              Also,  the ``From:'' and ``Sender:'' fields are examined for the
              name of the sender.

       [1m-d[4m[22mcategory[24m[1m.[4m[22mlevel...[0m
              Set  the  debugging  flag  for  [4mcategory[24m  to [4mlevel[24m.  [4mCategory[24m is
              either an integer or a name specifying the topic, and  [4mlevel[24m  an
              integer  specifying  the  level  of  debugging  output  desired.
              Higher levels generally mean more output.  More  than  one  flag
              can  be  specified  by  separating  them with commas.  A list of
              numeric debugging categories can be found in the TRACEFLAGS file
              in the sendmail source distribution.
              The  option [1m-d0.1 [22mprints the version of [1msendmail [22mand the options

              Most other categories are only useful with, and  documented  in,
              [1msendmail[22m's source code.

       [1m-F[4m[22mfullname[0m
              Set the full name of the sender.

       [1m-f[4m[22mname[24m Sets  the name of the ``from'' person (i.e., the envelope sender
              of the mail).  This address may also be used in the From: header
              if  that header is missing during initial submission.  The enve-
              lope sender address is used as the recipient for delivery status
              notifications  and may also appear in a Return-Path: header.  [1m-f[0m
              should only be used by ``trusted'' users (normally [4mroot[24m, [4mdaemon[24m,
              and  [4mnetwork[24m)  or  if the person you are trying to become is the
              same as the person you  are.   Otherwise,  an  X-Authentication-
              Warning header will be added to the message.

       [1m-h[4m[22mN[24m    Set the hop count to [4mN[24m.  The hop count is incremented every time
              the  mail  is  processed.   When it reaches a limit, the mail is
              returned with an error message, the victim of an aliasing  loop.
              If  not  specified,  ``Received:''  lines  in  the  message  are
              counted.

              file.

       [1m-L [4m[22mtag[24m Set  the identifier used in syslog messages to the supplied [4mtag[24m.

       [1m-N [4m[22mdsn[24m Set delivery status notification conditions to [4mdsn[24m, which can be
              `never'  for  no  notifications or a comma separated list of the
              values `failure' to be notified if delivery failed,  `delay'  to
              be notified if delivery is delayed, and `success' to be notified
              when the message is successfully delivered.

              Set option [4moption[24m to the specified [4mvalue[24m.  This form  uses  long
              names.  See below for more details.

       [1m-o[4m[22mx[24m [4mvalue[0m
              Set  option  [4mx[24m  to  the  specified [4mvalue[24m.  This form uses single
              character names only.  The short names are not described in this
              manual  page;  see the [4mSendmail[24m [4mInstallation[24m [4mand[24m [4mOperation[24m [4mGuide[0m
              for details.

       [1m-p[4m[22mprotocol[0m
              Set the name of the protocol used to receive the message.   This
              can be a simple protocol name such as ``UUCP'' or a protocol and
              hostname, such as ``UUCP:ucbvax''.

       [1m-q[22m[[4mtime[24m]
              Process saved messages in the queue at given intervals.  If [4mtime[0m
              is  omitted,  process the queue once.  [4mTime[24m is given as a tagged
              number, with `s' being seconds, `m' being minutes (default), `h'
              being  hours, `d' being days, and `w' being weeks.  For example,
              `-q1h30m' or `-q90m' would both set  the  timeout  to  one  hour
              thirty  minutes.   By  default,  [1msendmail  [22mwill run in the back-
              ground.  This option can be used safely with [1m-bd[22m.

       [1m-qp[22m[[4mtime[24m]
              Similar to [1m-q[4m[22mtime[24m, except that instead of periodically forking a
              child  to  process the queue, sendmail forks a single persistent
              child for each queue  that  alternates  between  processing  the
              queue and sleeping.  The sleep time is given as the argument; it
              defaults to 1 second.  The process will always sleep at least  5
              seconds if the queue was empty in the previous queue run.

       [1m-q[22mf    Process  saved messages in the queue once and do not fork(), but
              run in the foreground.

       [1m-q[22mG[4mname[0m

       [1m-q[22m[[4m![24m]I[4msubstr[0m
              Limit processed jobs to those containing [4msubstr[24m as  a  substring
              of the queue id or not when [4m![24m  is specified.

       [1m-q[22m[[4m![24m]Q[4msubstr[0m
              Limit  processed jobs to quarantined jobs containing [4msubstr[24m as a
              substring of the quarantine reason or not when [4m![24m  is  specified.

       [1m-q[22m[[4m![24m]R[4msubstr[0m
              Limit  processed  jobs to those containing [4msubstr[24m as a substring
              of one of the recipients or not when [4m![24m  is specified.

       [1m-q[22m[[4m![24m]S[4msubstr[0m
              Limit processed jobs to those containing [4msubstr[24m as  a  substring
              of the sender or not when [4m![24m  is specified.

       [1m-Q[22m[reason]
              Quarantine a normal queue items with the given reason or unquar-
              antine quarantined queue items if  no  reason  is  given.   This
              should  only  be  used  with some sort of item matching using as
              described above.

       [1m-R [4m[22mreturn[0m
              Set the amount of the message to  be  returned  if  the  message
              bounces.   The  [4mreturn[24m  parameter  can  be  `full' to return the
              entire message or `hdrs' to return only  the  headers.   In  the
              latter case also local bounces return only the headers.

       [1m-r[4m[22mname[24m An alternate and obsolete form of the [1m-f [22mflag.

       [1m-t     [22mRead  message  for recipients.  To:, Cc:, and Bcc: lines will be
              scanned for recipient addresses.  The Bcc: line will be  deleted
              before transmission.

       [1m-V [4m[22menvid[0m
              Set the original envelope id.  This is propagated across SMTP to
              servers that support DSNs and is returned in DSN-compliant error
              messages.

       [1m-v     [22mGo  into verbose mode.  Alias expansions will be announced, etc.

       [1m-X [4m[22mlogfile[0m
              Log all traffic in and out of mailers in the indicated log file.
              This  should  only be used as a last resort for debugging mailer
              bugs.  It will log a lot of data very quickly.

       [1m--     [22mStop processing command flags and use the rest of the  arguments
              as addresses.

   [1mOptions[0m
       There  are  also  a number of processing options that may be set.  Nor-
       mally these will only be used by a system administrator.   Options  may
       be  set either on the command line using the [1m-o [22mflag (for short names),
       the [1m-O [22mflag (for long names), or in the configuration file.  This is  a
       partial  list  limited to those options that are likely to be useful on
       the command line and only shows the long names;  for  a  complete  list
       (and  details),  consult the [4mSendmail[24m [4mInstallation[24m [4mand[24m [4mOperation[24m [4mGuide[24m.
       The options are:

       AliasFile=[4mfile[0m
              Use alternate alias file.

       HoldExpensive
              On mailers that are  considered  ``expensive''  to  connect  to,
              don't initiate immediate connection.  This requires queueing.

       CheckpointInterval=[4mN[0m
              Checkpoint  the  queue  file after every [4mN[24m successful deliveries
              (default 10).  This avoids excessive duplicate  deliveries  when
              sending to long mailing lists interrupted by system crashes.

       DeliveryMode=[4mx[0m
              Set the delivery mode to [4mx[24m.  Delivery modes are `i' for interac-
              tive (synchronous) delivery, `b' for  background  (asynchronous)
              delivery, `q' for queue only - i.e., actual delivery is done the
              next time the queue is run, and `d' for deferred - the  same  as
              `q'  except that database lookups for maps which have set the -D
              option (default for the host map) are avoided.

       ErrorMode=[4mx[0m
              Set error processing to mode [4mx[24m.  Valid modes  are  `m'  to  mail
              back  the error message, `w' to ``write'' back the error message
              (or mail it back if the sender is not logged in), `p'  to  print
              the  errors  on  the terminal (default), `q' to throw away error
              messages (only exit status is returned), and `e' to  do  special
              processing  for  the BerkNet.  If the text of the message is not
              mailed back by modes `m' or `w' and if the sender  is  local  to
              this  machine,  a  copy  of  the message is appended to the file
              [4mdead.letter[24m in the sender's home directory.

       SaveFromLine
              Save UNIX-style From lines at the front of messages.

       MaxHopCount=[4mN[0m
              The maximum number of times a  message  is  allowed  to  ``hop''
              before we decide it is in a loop.

       IgnoreDots
              Do  not  take dots on a line by themselves as a message termina-
              tor.

       SendMimeErrors
              Send error messages in MIME format.  If not set, the DSN (Deliv-
              ery Status Notification) SMTP extension is disabled.

       ConnectionCacheTimeout=[4mtimeout[0m
              Set connection cache timeout.

       ConnectionCacheSize=[4mN[0m
              Set connection cache size.

       LogLevel=[4mn[0m
              The log level.

       MeToo=[4mFalse[0m
              Don't send to ``me'' (the sender) if I am in an alias expansion.

       CheckAliases
              Validate the right hand side of aliases during  a  newaliases(1)
              command.

       OldStyleHeaders
              If  set,  this  message may have old style headers.  If not set,
              this message is guaranteed to have new style headers (i.e., com-
              mas  instead  of spaces between addresses).  If set, an adaptive
              algorithm is used that will correctly determine the header  for-
              mat in most cases.

       QueueDirectory=[4mqueuedir[0m
              Select the directory in which to queue messages.

       StatusFile=[4mfile[0m
              Save statistics in the named file.

       Timeout.queuereturn=[4mtime[0m
              Set  the  timeout  on  undelivered  messages in the queue to the
              specified time.  After delivery has failed (e.g., because  of  a
              host  being  down) for this amount of time, failed messages will
              be returned to the sender.  The default is five days.

       UserDatabaseSpec=[4muserdatabase[0m
              If set, a user database is consulted to get forwarding  informa-
              tion.   You  can consider this an adjunct to the aliasing mecha-
              nism, except that the database is intended  to  be  distributed;
              aliases  are local to a particular host.  This may not be avail-
              able if your sendmail does not have the USERDB  option  compiled
              in.

       ForkEachJob
              Fork  each  job during queue runs.  May be convenient on memory-
              poor machines.

       SevenBitInput
              Strip incoming messages to seven bits.

       EightBitMode=[4mmode[0m
              Set the handling of eight bit input to seven bit destinations to
              [4mmode[24m: m (mimefy) will convert to seven-bit MIME format, p (pass)
              will pass it as eight  bits  (but  violates  protocols),  and  s
              (strict) will bounce the message.

       MinQueueAge=[4mtimeout[0m
              Sets  how  long a job must ferment in the queue between attempts
              to send it.

       DefaultCharSet=[4mcharset[0m
              Sets the default character set used to label 8-bit data that  is
              not otherwise labelled.

       DialDelay=[4msleeptime[0m
              If  opening  a connection fails, sleep for [4msleeptime[24m seconds and
              try again.  Useful on dial-on-demand sites.

       NoRecipientAction=[4maction[0m
              Set the behaviour when there are no recipient headers (To:,  Cc:
              or  Bcc:)  in  the  message  to  [4maction[24m: none leaves the message
              unchanged, add-to adds a To: header with  the  envelope  recipi-
              ents,  add-apparently-to  adds an Apparently-To: header with the
              envelope recipients, add-bcc adds an empty Bcc: header, and add-
              to-undisclosed  adds  a  header reading `To: undisclosed-recipi-
              ents:;'.

       MaxDaemonChildren=[4mN[0m
              Sets the maximum number of children that an incoming SMTP daemon
              will allow to spawn at any time to [4mN[24m.

       ConnectionRateThrottle=[4mN[0m
              Sets  the  maximum  number of connections per second to the SMTP
              port to [4mN[24m.

       In aliases, the first character of a name may  be  a  vertical  bar  to
       cause  interpretation  of the rest of the name as a command to pipe the
       mail to.  It may be necessary to quote the name to keep  [1msendmail  [22mfrom
       suppressing  the  blanks from between arguments.  For example, a common
       alias is:

              msgs: "|/usr/bin/msgs -s"

       Aliases may also have the syntax ``:include:[4mfilename[24m'' to ask  [1msendmail[0m
       to read the named file for a list of recipients.  For example, an alias
       such as:

              poets: ":include:/usr/local/lib/poets.list"

       would read [4m/usr/local/lib/poets.list[24m for the list of  addresses  making
       up the group.

       [1mSendmail  [22mreturns an exit status describing what it did.  The codes are
       defined in <[4msysexits.h[24m>:

       EX_NOUSER
              User name not recognized.

       EX_UNAVAILABLE
              Catchall meaning necessary resources were not available.

       EX_SYNTAX
              Syntax error in address.

       EX_SOFTWARE
              Internal software error, including bad arguments.

       EX_OSERR
              Temporary operating system error, such as ``cannot fork''.

       EX_NOHOST
              Host name not recognized.

       EX_TEMPFAIL
              Message could not be sent immediately, but was queued.

[1mNOTES[0m
       [1msendmail  [22moften  gets  blamed  for  many problems that are actually the
       result of other problems, such as overly permissive modes  on  directo-
       ries.  For this reason, [1msendmail [22mchecks the modes on system directories
       and files to determine if they can be trusted.  Although  these  checks
       can be turned off and your system security reduced by setting the [1mDont-[0m
       [1mBlameSendmail [22moption, the permission problems  should  be  fixed.   For
