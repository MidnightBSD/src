.SH NAME
diff3 \- compare three files line by line
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B diff3
[\fIOPTION\fR]... \fIMYFILE OLDFILE YOURFILE\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
Compare three files line by line.
.PP
Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
.TP
\fB\-A\fR, \fB\-\-show\-all\fR
output all changes, bracketing conflicts
.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-ed\fR
output ed script incorporating changes
from OLDFILE to YOURFILE into MYFILE
.TP
\fB\-E\fR, \fB\-\-show\-overlap\fR
like \fB\-e\fR, but bracket conflicts
.TP
\fB\-3\fR, \fB\-\-easy\-only\fR
like \fB\-e\fR, but incorporate only nonoverlapping changes
.TP
\fB\-x\fR, \fB\-\-overlap\-only\fR
like \fB\-e\fR, but incorporate only overlapping changes
.TP
\fB\-X\fR
like \fB\-x\fR, but bracket conflicts
.TP
\fB\-i\fR
append `w' and `q' commands to ed scripts
.TP
\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-merge\fR
output actual merged file, according to
\fB\-A\fR if no other options are given
.TP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-text\fR
treat all files as text
.TP
\fB\-\-strip\-trailing\-cr\fR
strip trailing carriage return on input
.TP
\fB\-T\fR, \fB\-\-initial\-tab\fR
make tabs line up by prepending a tab
.TP
\fB\-\-diff\-program\fR=\fIPROGRAM\fR
use PROGRAM to compare files
.TP
\fB\-L\fR, \fB\-\-label\fR=\fILABEL\fR
use LABEL instead of file name
(can be repeated up to three times)
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
display this help and exit
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
output version information and exit
.PP
The default output format is a somewhat human\-readable representation of
the changes.
.PP
The \fB\-e\fR, \fB\-E\fR, \fB\-x\fR, \fB\-X\fR (and corresponding long) options cause an ed script
to be output instead of the default.
.PP
Finally, the \fB\-m\fR (\fB\-\-merge\fR) option causes diff3 to do the merge internally
and output the actual merged file.  For unusual input, this is more
robust than using ed.
.PP
If a FILE is `\-', read standard input.
Exit status is 0 if successful, 1 if conflicts, 2 if trouble.
