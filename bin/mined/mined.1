.Sh NAME
.Nm mined
.Nd emergency text editor
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is a simple text editor primarily designed for use when a
system is booted single-user and has no
.Pa /usr
(and thus no access to
.Xr vi 1 ) .
Simple help can be obtained by hitting the F1 key while in the editor.
CTRL+W writes out the file and CTRL+X exits the editor.
.Pp
The terminal type is hardwired to either an xterm or cons25 (video console).
The editor understands stty
rows and columns but is otherwise meant to be fairly minimal in scope.
