.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm getfacl
.Nd get ACL information
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl dhq
.Op Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility writes discretionary access control information associated with
the specified file(s) to standard output.
If the
.Xr getconf 1
utility indicates that
.Eq { } Va _POSIX_ACL_EXTENDED
is not in effect for a
.Ar file
then the standard discretionary access permissions are interpreted as
an ACL containing only the required ACL entries.
.Pp
The following option is available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl d
The operation applies to the default ACL of a directory instead of the
access ACL.
An error is generated if a default ACL cannot be associated with
.Ar file .
.It Fl h
If the target of the operation is a symbolic link, return the ACL from
the symbolic link itself rather than following the link.
.It Fl q
Do not write commented information about file name and ownership.
This is
useful when dealing with filenames with unprintable characters.
.El
.Pp
The following operand is available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ar file
A pathname of a file whose ACL shall be retrieved.
If
.Ar file
is not specified, or a
.Ar file
is specified as
.Fl ,
then
.Nm
reads a list of pathnames, each terminated by one newline character,
from the standard input.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Dl getfacl /
.Pp
Retrieve ACL for the directory
.Pa / .
.Pp
.Dl getfacl -d /
.Pp
Retrieve the default ACL for the directory
.Pa / ,
if any.

of the
.Tn TrustedBSD
Project and introduced in
.Fx 5.0 .
