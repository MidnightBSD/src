.SH DESCRIPTION
.HP
\fIldns_axfr_start\fR()
.PP
.HP
\fIldns_axfr_next\fR()
Get the next stream of RRs in a \%AXFR
\.br
\fBresolver\fR: the resolver to use. First ldns_axfr_start() must be
called
\.br
Returns ldns_rr the next \%RR from the \%AXFR stream
After you get this returned \%RR (not \%NULL: on error), then check if 
ldns_axfr_complete() is true to see if the zone transfer has completed.
.PP
.HP
\fIldns_axfr_abort\fR()
Abort a transfer that is in progress
\.br
\fBresolver\fR: the resolver that is used
.PP
.HP
\fIldns_axfr_complete\fR()
Returns true if the axfr transfer has completed (i.e. 2 \%SOA RRs and no errors were encountered
\.br
\fBresolver\fR: the resolver that is used
\.br
Returns bool true if axfr transfer was completed without error
.PP
.HP
\fIldns_axfr_last_pkt\fR()
Returns a pointer to the last ldns_pkt that was sent by the server in the \%AXFR transfer
usable for instance to get the error code on failure
\.br
\fBres\fR: the resolver that was used in the axfr transfer
\.br
Returns ldns_pkt the last packet sent
