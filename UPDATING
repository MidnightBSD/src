Updating Information for MidnightBSD users

Items affecting the mports and packages system can be found in
/usr/mports/UPDATING. 

20070308:
	Added mfi which supports LSI Logic MegaRAID SAS devices including
	the Dell perc5i.

20070206:
	Imported OpenBSD's sudo into source. Please install
	/usr/src/usr.bin/sudo/lib first before building.

	Those who install from a snapshot after this date
	will not be effected.

20070119:
	Added audit group.  Be sure to add audit to your /etc/group file
	before installing world.

	hostapd was updated to 0.4.8.

	An accidental commit in usr.sbin/bluetooth/hccontrol was fixed to
	unbreak world.

	wpa_supplicant was updated.

	For stability and compatibility reasons, it was decided that MidnightBSD
	sync with FreeBSD 6.1 Release.  Nearly every change between the original
	fork date of February 24, 2006 and the release of FreeBSD 6.1 in May
	2006 will be merged.  Beyond this, MidnightBSD will be a "real" fork and
	will not sync every little change with FreeBSD.

20061231:
	Updated COPYRIGHT for 2007.

	Updated and bumped libutil after importing NetBSD efun(3) functions.

	Added MidnightBSD_version and bumped the FreeBSD version as we've
	synced all commits between the fork and that version.  It is now safe
	to assume MidnightBSD is compatible with FreeBSD RELENG_6 from
	Feb 26, 2006.

	Added spell(1) and deroff(1) from NetBSD.  Also added additional
	dict files to work with it. /usr/share/dict/american, 
	/usr/share/dict/british and /usr/share/dict/special/math

	Numerous man page and bug fixes.

20061226:
	Setup /usr/share/examples/cvsup SUPfiles for the new
	MidnightBSD CVSup server. 

	Fix a bug in burncd where it would continue forever while
	erasing CDRW media.

	Add csup to /usr/bin.  csup is a CVSup replacement written
	in C. 

	Fixed a bug with bsnmpd build from Oct 30.  

	Corrected some race conditions and fixed a few bugs in
	geom.  Imported changes from FreeBSD RELENG_6.

20061225:
	Fixed a typo in src/lib/libc/sparc64/fpu/fpu_implode.c
	that caused long double to long and long long 
	conversion of negative numbers to always result in -1.

20061221:
	Fixed acpi_battery.c to not report an ERROR if no
	batteries are present.

	Performed some minor updates on the RL and RE NIC drivers.
	RL should no longer panic when trying to print errors.

	Corrected a bug with TTY.

20061218:
	Corrected a bug with libpthread where newly created suspended
	threads don't get scheduled.

20061206:
	Fixed a typo with the firewire security patch.

20061129:
	Minor cleanups to utilities in bin.

	Fixed msdos file system short file name behavior to match
	FreeBSD.

20061031:
	Updated man pages in section 7.

20061030:
 	Updated sys/dev/drm to support intel 915 and radeon 
	r300 cards properly.  

	Synced snmpd with FreeBSD-stable.

	Fixed a bug in rm which could cause data loss.	

20061027:
	Added Intel ICH8 and nForce 5 support to ATA. cam, mpt,
	random, kbdmux, atkbd, and usb were updated.  Changes
	to clearing registers on SSE enabled processors (i386)
	commited.  

	lukemftpd updated.  

	openssh rc script was altered which effects initial
	seeding.  

20061014:
	Workaround for em driver problem on shared IRQ.

	Started removal of alpha support.

20061013:
	ATA driver was updated.  USB/USB1/USB2 types added.

20061010: 
	OpenSSH was updated to 4.4p1.   

20060909:
	OpenNTPD was added to MidnightBSD.  Run make delete-old to remove
	the old ntpd daemon.

	cat has a new option -D which allows you to timestamp output
	on a per line basis.

	The kernel has a keyboard mux which allows you to have multiple
	keyboard connected simultaneously.  USB keyboard support was also
	improved with this patch.

	The Intel em driver was updated.  Network performance was greatly
	increased on many systems.  Additional models are supported.

	The ATA driver was patched to fix a potential deadlock.

	Bind was patched to fix a potential denial of service condition.

20060817:
	ksh has been added to the base system.  If you previously had
	the port installed, it will be overwritten on the next buildworld.



	To build a kernel
	-----------------
	If you are updating from a prior version of MidnightBSD (even one just
	a few days old), you should follow this procedure. With a
	/usr/obj tree with a fresh buildworld,
	make -DALWAYS_CHECK_MAKE buildkernel KERNCONF=YOUR_KERNEL_HERE
	make -DALWAYS_CHECK_MAKE installkernel KERNCONF=YOUR_KERNEL_HERE

	To test a kernel once
	---------------------
	If you just want to boot a kernel once (because you are not sure
	if it works, or if you want to boot a known bad kernel to provide
	debugging information) run
	make installkernel KERNCONF=YOUR_KERNEL_HERE KODIR=/boot/testkernel
	nextboot -k testkernel

	To just build a kernel when you know that it won't mess you up
	--------------------------------------------------------------
	This assumes you are already running a 6.X system.  Replace
	${arch} with the architecture of your machine (e.g. "i386",
	"amd64", "ia64", "pc98", "sparc64", etc).

	cd src/sys/${arch}/conf
	config KERNEL_NAME_HERE
	cd ../compile/KERNEL_NAME_HERE
	make depend
	make
	make install

	If this fails, go to the "To build a kernel" section.

	To rebuild everything and install it on the current system.
	-----------------------------------------------------------
	# Note: sometimes if you are running current you gotta do more than
	# is listed here if you are upgrading from a really old current.

	<make sure you have good level 0 dumps>
	make buildworld
	make kernel KERNCONF=YOUR_KERNEL_HERE
							[1]
	<reboot in single user>				[3]
	mergemaster -p					[5]
	make installworld
	make delete-old
	mergemaster					[4]
	<reboot>


	To cross-install current onto a separate partition
	--------------------------------------------------
	# In this approach we use a separate partition to hold
	# current's root, 'usr', and 'var' directories.   A partition
	# holding "/", "/usr" and "/var" should be about 2GB in
	# size.

	<make sure you have good level 0 dumps>
	<boot into -stable>
	make buildworld
	make buildkernel KERNCONF=YOUR_KERNEL_HERE
	<maybe newfs current's root partition>
	<mount current's root partition on directory ${CURRENT_ROOT}>
	make installworld DESTDIR=${CURRENT_ROOT}
	cd src/etc; make distribution DESTDIR=${CURRENT_ROOT} # if newfs'd
	make installkernel KERNCONF=YOUR_KERNEL_HERE DESTDIR=${CURRENT_ROOT}
	cp /etc/fstab ${CURRENT_ROOT}/etc/fstab 		   # if newfs'd
	<edit ${CURRENT_ROOT}/etc/fstab to mount "/" from the correct partition>
	<reboot into current>
	<do a "native" rebuild/install as described in the previous section>
	<maybe install compatibility libraries from src/lib/compat>
 	<reboot>


	To upgrade in-place from 5.x-stable or higher to 6.x-stable
	-----------------------------------------------------------
	<make sure you have good level 0 dumps>
	make buildworld					[9]
	make kernel KERNCONF=YOUR_KERNEL_HERE		[8]
							[1]
	<reboot in single user>				[3]
	mergemaster -p					[5]
	make installworld
	make delete-old
	mergemaster -i					[4]
	<reboot>

	Make sure that you've read the UPDATING file to understand the
	tweaks to various things you need.  At this point in the life
	cycle of current, things change often and you are on your own
	to cope.  The defaults can also change, so please read ALL of
	the UPDATING entries.

	Also, if you are tracking -current, you must be subscribed to
	freebsd-current@freebsd.org.  Make sure that before you update
	your sources that you have read and understood all the recent
	messages there.  If in doubt, please track -stable which has
	much fewer pitfalls.

	[1] If you have third party modules, such as vmware, you
	should disable them at this point so they don't crash your
	system on reboot.

	[3] From the bootblocks, boot -s, and then do
		fsck -p
		mount -u /
		mount -a
		cd src
		adjkerntz -i		# if CMOS is wall time
	Also, when doing a major release upgrade, it is required that
	you boot into single user mode to do the installworld.

	[4] Note: This step is non-optional.  Failure to do this step
	can result in a significant reduction in the functionality of the
	system.  Attempting to do it by hand is not recommended and those
	that pursue this avenue should read this file carefully, as well
	as the archives of freebsd-current and freebsd-hackers mailing lists
	for potential gotchas.

	[5] Usually this step is a noop.  However, from time to time
	you may need to do this if you get unknown user in the following
	step.  It never hurts to do it all the time.

	[8] In order to have a kernel that can run the 5.x binaries
	needed to do an installworld, you must include the COMPAT_FREEBSD5
	option in your kernel.  Failure to do so may leave you with a system
	that is hard to boot to recover. A similar kernel option COMPAT_FREEBSD5
	is required to run the 5.x binaries on more recent kernels.

	Make sure that you merge any new devices from GENERIC since the
	last time you updated your kernel config file.

	[9] When checking out sources, you must include the -P flag to have
	cvs prune empty directories.

	If CPUTYPE is defined in your /etc/make.conf, make sure to use the
	"?=" instead of the "=" assignment operator, so that buildworld can
	override the CPUTYPE if it needs to.

	MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX must be defined in an environment variable, and
	not on the command line, or in /etc/make.conf.  buildworld will
	warn if it is improperly defined.
