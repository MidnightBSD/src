	mksh R39b

	libffi (ffi) 3.0.9

20100206:
	WITHOUT_LIB32 is no longer needed on AMD64.  GCC was fixed to
	properly pass arguments to ld.

	re(4) and rl(4) have been updated to support several new
	realtek chipsets.  Performance has been improved on re(4).

20100204:
	Fix a bug cropping up on AMD64 MidnightBSD with sftp
	segfaulting.  

20100116:
	Import ash changes from FreeBSD (bin/sh) 8-Stable.

	BIND 9.6.1-P2

20100110:
	Import Sendmail 8.14.4. Fix for SSL vulnerability.

	posix_spawn(3) added to MidnightBSD libc.  Users may need to build and
	install libc before doing a full buildworld when upating from 0.2 or
	older current systems.

	kqueue(2) was modified to support portions of libdispatch functionality.

20100106:
	Bind security update.  Fix a bug with DNSSEC that causes negative
	cache entries and thus a possible DNS cache poisoning attack.

	Fix a bug in ZFS that can reset permissions on system crashes.

20091228:
	amdtemp(4) was added.  It allows one to monitor to the temperature
	of an AMD CPU such as a Phenom.

20091205:
	OpenSSL security fix

	The SSL version 3 and TLS protocols support session renegotiation without
	cryptographically tying the new session parameters to the old parameters.

20091128:
	OpenBSD sensors framework imported including sensorsd(8)

20091126:
	OpenNTPD 4.4 import

	Update OpenSSH to 5.3p1

	mksh R39

20091124:
	cpdup updated from DragonFly to 1.15

	tzdata2009s updated with latest timezone data for November 2009.

20091010:
	amd64 users should use WITHOUT_LIB32=yes in /etc/make.conf for now
	to test current.

	Revert unicode filename fixes from ntfs code.  This was causing chaos
	on amd64 systems.

20091006:
	Update timezone data with tzdata2009n with the Pakistan and
	Argentina changes.

	Sync several userland utilities with versions from FreeBSD 7.0 in
	sbin and usr.sbin.

20090919:
	Update timezone data with tzdate2009m from September 2009.

20090729:
	Patch for Bind 9 security vulnerability. a dynmaic update packet 
	can trigger an assertion and cause named to exit

20090606:
	Remove PCC from the base system.  This compiler will not work
	as a system compiler for us as we've got some userland investment
	in C++ code and may have Objective-C in the future.  We're stuck
	with a solution that supports these three languages at a minimum.

	I had wanted to keep it as an optional compiler because it is
	fast, however too many users want to try to use it for the base
	system which makes no sense.

	A hack was added for Cypress based usb hard drive enclosures to
	the kernel.  This should cut down on commands it claims to support
	but does not (at the cam layer).  Found while testing ZFS on
	an external device.

20090520:
	The powerd daemon no longer starts automatically to improve
	compatibility with many systems.  However, there is a new
	installer option in the startup section to enable it. This
	makes it easier to enable for users that have working systems. I		thought it was only a problem on older hardware, but it freaks
	out my new Phenom too.

20090502:
	OpenSSH 5.2p1 import

	ale(4) connected to the build. (kernel module only)

20090501:
	Imported makefs utility from NetBSD/FreeBSD

20090422:
	OpenSSL security update

	The function ASN1_STRING_print_ex does not properly validate the lengths
of BMPString or UniversalString objects before attempting to print them.

20090415:
	Created a Symbol.map for libc/ohash symbols

	Updated several usr/bin usr/sbin utilities.

	Corrected a bug with Makefile.inc1 causing the bootstrap
	tools to fail.

20090405:
	xorg 7.4 wants to configure its input devices via hald which does not
	yet work with USB. If the keyboard/mouse does not work in xorg then
	add
		Option "AllowEmptyInput" "off"
	to your ServerLayout section.  This will cause X to use the configured
	kbd and mouse sections from your xorg.conf

20090403:
	mksh was disconnected a few day ago do to bugs with
	buildworld and mports.  Now, connect it back 
	for use as /bin/sh with a conditional called
	MK_ASH.  By default, ash is the standard /bin/sh
	but we may change this later.  This will allow further
	testing by users and developers of mksh without
	causing an unpleasant default experience.  In the
	long run, we need to fix mksh compatibility.

20090328:
	Bring in mksh R37 from CVS. The dot.mkshrc files for root 
	and skel were changed.  mksh(1) now replaces ash aka sh(1)
	as the default /bin/sh.  Please report bugs with
	ports, etc. The ash code will remain in the repo for awhile
	as I decide if we'll add something like MK_SHELL_ASH as
	an optional build parameter.  

	ahd was disconnected from the lint environment until
	the compiler bug is sorted (by updating gcc?)

	Remove freebsd-tips from fortune files and change the
	default for login and profile.

20090327:
	Update libarchive to 2.5.5, tar, and add bsdcpio.

	Also previously, ctriv has been connecting Perl 5.10
	to the build (part of os).  This will have an impact
	on mports.

20090325:
	Update Bind to 9.4.3-P1

	Update mksh to R36b

	Update tcpdump to 3.9.8, fix libpcap to work with current.

	Update pnpinfo, sync with FreeBSD.

20090115:
	Fix a problem with DNSSEC and BIND.

20090110:
	For applications using OpenSSL for SSL connections, an invalid SSL
	certificate may be interpreted as valid.  This could for example be
	used by an attacker to perform a man-in-the-middle attack.

	Other applications which use the OpenSSL EVP API may similarly be
	affected.

	Stop cross site request forgery attacks in lukemftpd

20090104:
	Import GNU libreadline 5.2

20090101:
	Update time zone data to 2008i.

20081231:
	Correct a problem where bluetooth and netgraph sockets are not
	properly initialized.

	Happy 2009.

20081206:
	Due to the massive change in the underlying system under way,
	we're naming the next release 1.0.  The sys/sys/param.h was
	changed accordingly.  ipfilter and ncurses were corrected
	using __MidnightBSD__ tests in the code.  

	The GENERIC kernel config was caught up on i386 today.  Consider
	i386 still broken, but amd64 is running again. 

	mdoc.local was updated with the new MidnightBSD version info.

	batt(1) was rewritten in C.  It now supports several flags and
	runs about 8 times faster on my laptop.  The default output
	shows the number of minutes of battery life remaining and the
	percentage.  You can use -u to display the number of batteries or
	-c to get script friendly output.  Consult the man page for more.

20081204:
	Work has completed on importing ZFS, jemalloc, several
	new devices, SCTP, updated pf, a new tempfs, linuxolator 2.6 kernel
	support, improved locking for file desc., audit (openbsm), 
	openssl .98e, nfe, imporved intel high def audio, midi, updated
	intel gigabit (em), support for several wifi cards (intel), ...

	Renamed 0.3-CURRENT officially. Switched to using MidnightBSD version
	data from param.h instead of the FreeBSD version.  This means
	testing is now possible in the ports tree for the version
	and that any ports or code relying on the FreeBSD version from
	sys/sys/param.h will need to be fixed.

20080905:
	update nve(4) to support new hardware.

20080801:
	Import OpenBSM 1.0

	Modify src/release to create 3 isos instead of 2 for packages.

	etc/rc.d/firstboot now enables kdm, gnustep + slim and bsdstats.

	Many ia64, alpha, powerpc items were removed. 

	The recent diffutils 2.8.7 import was fixed.

20080703:
	pcc was not installed properly when setting DESTDIR for live cds, 
	or posibly jails. 

20080627:
	Add firmware(9), WEP, CCMP, TKIP to GENERIC.

	Add glabel to GENERIC.

	Intel ICH8 mobile chipset used on some iMacs included with ata.

	pcc connected to the build on i386. (alternative compiler)

	ath added to GENERIC.  (Atheros wireless NICs) on amd64/i386

20080528:
	Sendmail 8.14.3

20080516:
	ssh-vulnkey allows you to look for vulnerable ssh keys that
	were generated on Debian and Ubuntu hosts over the last
	few years.  sshd can block offending keys with a configuration
	option.

	The elf note on binaries is now set to MidnightBSD.

20080514:
	Fixed a number of problems with pcc.  It is not yet connected
	to the build, but usable on i386 hosts.  You may use it 
	by make; make install in /usr/src/usr.bin/pcc.  It will
	install in /usr/local as some of the files conflict with
	GCC versions. __MidnightBSD__ is defined in PCC as well.

	System headers were fixed to allow pcc to compile many binaries
	on MidnightBSD.  bin/cp will work now for instance.

20080430:
	__MidnightBSD__ is now defined via gcc.  This can be tested
	to determine we're running on MidnightBSD in the preprocessor.

20080429:
	Import bind 9.4.2 with threading

	libpthread (KSE) and libthr are built earlier
	
	pcvt(4) removed!

	Alias added for core2 cpus.

	Alpha and PC98 only utilities removed from usr/sbin

	syslogd, adduser, rmuser, mergemaster and mailwrapper have been
	improved.  See the man pages for info.

	periodic scripts will not send emails with empty message bodies.
	See mailwrapper fix.

20080410:
	Sync cpdup with DragonFly.  Add parallel transaction support and
	-l flag to line-buffer stdout and stderr.

20080406:
	Import bzip2 1.05
	Import OpenSSH 4.9p1

20080322:

20080316:
	FIx a problem with gif0 tunnels and neighbors with IPV6.

20080312:
	Add lndir from X.org.  This aides in the porting of MirPorts.

	New OS versions were added to the mapage code (groff)

20080310:
	Correct a buffer overflow in ppp.

20080308:
	Remove /usr/X11R6 from manpath config.

20080307:
	Atheros driver no longer has several options set
	which corrects building in tinderbox on all three platforms.

	Added a new macro to sx.h which returns true if the current
	thread holds an exclusive lock on a specifix sx.

	Removed OS/2's HPFS file system.   It's not maintained and
	I don't know anyone using OS/2 or ecomstation these days.
	My copy is in the closet collecting dust.

20080306:
	Synced tinderbox with FreeBSD.  Modified it for MidnightBSD.
	Developers can now use it to check src builds.

20080303:

20080228:
	Remplaced the random IP id generation code with a new
	version by Amit Klein.

20080221:
	Sendfile write only permissions fix.

	Removed some HPFS and PC98 code.

	iso639 file sycned with DragonFly.

20080128:

	so multiple servers are used.

	Fix an issue with fork() in libpthread.

20080121:
	Add virtualization detection to set the HZ rate
	according to a VM present.  VMWare and Parallels
	should work better like this.

	Change to full x11 install in sysinstall.  Add
	xorg 7 support.

20080115:
	Fix the handling of PTY's.  CVE-2008-0216

20070911:
	Updated mksh to version R31b.

	Fixed stderr output in libpthread.  Previously it was
	written to stdout.

20070831:
	Added dot.mkshrc file to support the recent change to 
	mksh from OpenBSD's ksh derived from pdksh.  

	Added new firewall configuration.  ipfw is enabled by default
	with a "desktop" configuration.  Consult /etc/rc.firewall
	or ipfw show to see the ruleset used.  You can disable
	ipfw by setting firewall_enable="NO" in /etc/rc.conf This
	change only effects IPv4.  IPv6 does not have a firewall
	enabled by default.

20070814:
	Removed GNU tar source.  We've been using BSD tar 
	for awhile.

20070806:
	Finished removing umapfs and autofs from the tree.

20070804:
	BIND and Tcpdump have been patched for recent vulnerabilities.

	We switched to BSD cpio (pax).

20070719:
	Imported cpdup from DragonFly as /bin/cpdup

20070716:
	Update GNU cpio to 2.8. 

20070410:
	cvs was updated to 1.12.13.  cvsbug was removed.
	cvs now behaves similarly to DragonFly's cvs with
	most of their local changes.  

20070409:
	RELENG_0_1 was created. More aggresive changes will
	continue here.

20070406:
	Back out propolice.  propolice caused several problems
	with our threading libraries libthr and libpthread.  
	curthread was often NULL after the patch and many
	multithreaded applications would crash.  We plan to 
	work on either bringing in gcc 4.1 or developing a new
	patch which also corrects our threading issues later.

	It is more important to have a stable system for our
	mport work and other projects at this time.

	This is not a clean removal.  It is recommended that you
	have a recently SNAP CD handy.  You can either reinstall
	or perform a make buildworld and make buildkernel and 
	make installkernel.  Reboot on the cd and copy the contents
	of /bin, /sbin, /lib, /libexec, and /usr/bin, /usr/sbin,
	/usr/lib, and /usr/libexec to the respective directories on
	your disk.  Then you should be able to boot into single user
	mode and run make installworld.  You will need to run
	chflags noschg on some of the files if you can't overwrite
	them. 

	You will get __guard missing errors since we had to remove
	this from libc.

	You will need to rebuild any ports built while propolice was
	installed.

20070401:
	Importing propolice into MidnightBSD. Propolice is going to
	provide us with much greater security and stability in the
	long run. If upgrading from a pre-propolice system, please
	follow the these instructions:

	cd /usr/src/lib/libc && make obj && make && make install
	cd /usr/src/gnu/usr.bin/cc && make obj && make && make install
	cd /usr/src/lib/libpthread && make obj && make && make install
	cd /usr/src/lib/libthr && make obj && make && make install
	buildworld and kernel

	It is adviced that any mports which were installed and/or built
	prior to the propolice update also be updated. If any errors
	or issue are encounted, please contact security@midnightbsd.org
	and we will be sure to investigate and come up with an expeditious
	fix.

20070314:
	Remove send-pr from src.

	Switch to NetBSD's gzip.

	Bump MBSD minor revision.

20070313:
	Imported OpenSSH 4.6p1.

	Imported FreeBSD's libarchive and updated tar to work with it.

	Disabled debug statements cluttering up /var/log/messages for
	the tcp autobuf patch applied previously.

20070312:
	Synced several audio changes from FreeBSD 6.1. Removed the 
	BSD Daemon files from src/share.  

20070308:
	Added mfi which supports LSI Logic MegaRAID SAS devices including
	the Dell perc5i.

20070206:
	Imported OpenBSD's sudo into source. Please install
	/usr/src/usr.bin/sudo/lib first before building.

	Those who install from a snapshot after this date
	will not be effected.

20070119:
	Added audit group.  Be sure to add audit to your /etc/group file
	before installing world.

	hostapd was updated to 0.4.8.

	An accidental commit in usr.sbin/bluetooth/hccontrol was fixed to
	unbreak world.

	wpa_supplicant was updated.

	For stability and compatibility reasons, it was decided that MidnightBSD
	sync with FreeBSD 6.1 Release.  Nearly every change between the original
	fork date of February 24, 2006 and the release of FreeBSD 6.1 in May
	2006 will be merged.  Beyond this, MidnightBSD will be a "real" fork and
	will not sync every little change with FreeBSD.

20061231:
	Updated COPYRIGHT for 2007.

	Updated and bumped libutil after importing NetBSD efun(3) functions.

	Added MidnightBSD_version and bumped the FreeBSD version as we've
	synced all commits between the fork and that version.  It is now safe
	to assume MidnightBSD is compatible with FreeBSD RELENG_6 from
	Feb 26, 2006.

	Added spell(1) and deroff(1) from NetBSD.  Also added additional
	dict files to work with it. /usr/share/dict/american, 
	/usr/share/dict/british and /usr/share/dict/special/math

	Numerous man page and bug fixes.

20061226:
	Setup /usr/share/examples/cvsup SUPfiles for the new
	MidnightBSD CVSup server. 

	Fix a bug in burncd where it would continue forever while
	erasing CDRW media.

	Add csup to /usr/bin.  csup is a CVSup replacement written
	in C. 

	Fixed a bug with bsnmpd build from Oct 30.  

	Corrected some race conditions and fixed a few bugs in
	geom.  Imported changes from FreeBSD RELENG_6.

20061225:
	Fixed a typo in src/lib/libc/sparc64/fpu/fpu_implode.c
	that caused long double to long and long long 
	conversion of negative numbers to always result in -1.

20061221:
	Fixed acpi_battery.c to not report an ERROR if no
	batteries are present.

	Performed some minor updates on the RL and RE NIC drivers.
	RL should no longer panic when trying to print errors.

	Corrected a bug with TTY.

20061218:
	Corrected a bug with libpthread where newly created suspended
	threads don't get scheduled.

20061206:
	Fixed a typo with the firewire security patch.

20061129:
	Minor cleanups to utilities in bin.

	Fixed msdos file system short file name behavior to match
	FreeBSD.

20061031:
	Updated man pages in section 7.

20061030:
 	Updated sys/dev/drm to support intel 915 and radeon 
	r300 cards properly.  

	Synced snmpd with FreeBSD-stable.

	Fixed a bug in rm which could cause data loss.	

20061027:
	Added Intel ICH8 and nForce 5 support to ATA. cam, mpt,
	random, kbdmux, atkbd, and usb were updated.  Changes
	to clearing registers on SSE enabled processors (i386)
	commited.  

	lukemftpd updated.  

	openssh rc script was altered which effects initial
	seeding.  

20061014:
	Workaround for em driver problem on shared IRQ.

	Started removal of alpha support.

20061013:
	ATA driver was updated.  USB/USB1/USB2 types added.

20061010: 
	OpenSSH was updated to 4.4p1.   

20060909:
	OpenNTPD was added to MidnightBSD.  Run make delete-old to remove
	the old ntpd daemon.

	cat has a new option -D which allows you to timestamp output
	on a per line basis.

	The kernel has a keyboard mux which allows you to have multiple
	keyboard connected simultaneously.  USB keyboard support was also
	improved with this patch.

	The Intel em driver was updated.  Network performance was greatly
	increased on many systems.  Additional models are supported.

	The ATA driver was patched to fix a potential deadlock.

	Bind was patched to fix a potential denial of service condition.

20060817:
	ksh has been added to the base system.  If you previously had
	the port installed, it will be overwritten on the next buildworld.



	To build a kernel
	-----------------
	If you are updating from a prior version of MidnightBSD (even one just
	a few days old), you should follow this procedure. With a
	/usr/obj tree with a fresh buildworld,
	make -DALWAYS_CHECK_MAKE buildkernel KERNCONF=YOUR_KERNEL_HERE
	make -DALWAYS_CHECK_MAKE installkernel KERNCONF=YOUR_KERNEL_HERE

	To test a kernel once
	---------------------
	If you just want to boot a kernel once (because you are not sure
	if it works, or if you want to boot a known bad kernel to provide
	debugging information) run
	make installkernel KERNCONF=YOUR_KERNEL_HERE KODIR=/boot/testkernel
	nextboot -k testkernel

	To just build a kernel when you know that it won't mess you up
	--------------------------------------------------------------
	This assumes you are already running a 6.X system.  Replace
	${arch} with the architecture of your machine (e.g. "i386",
	"amd64", "ia64", "pc98", "sparc64", etc).

	cd src/sys/${arch}/conf
	config KERNEL_NAME_HERE
	cd ../compile/KERNEL_NAME_HERE
	make depend
	make
	make install

	If this fails, go to the "To build a kernel" section.

	To rebuild everything and install it on the current system.
	-----------------------------------------------------------
	# Note: sometimes if you are running current you gotta do more than
	# is listed here if you are upgrading from a really old current.

	<make sure you have good level 0 dumps>
	make buildworld
	make kernel KERNCONF=YOUR_KERNEL_HERE
							[1]
	<reboot in single user>				[3]
	mergemaster -p					[5]
	make installworld
	make delete-old
	mergemaster					[4]
	<reboot>


	To cross-install current onto a separate partition
	--------------------------------------------------
	# In this approach we use a separate partition to hold
	# current's root, 'usr', and 'var' directories.   A partition
	# holding "/", "/usr" and "/var" should be about 2GB in
	# size.

	<make sure you have good level 0 dumps>
	<boot into -stable>
	make buildworld
	make buildkernel KERNCONF=YOUR_KERNEL_HERE
	<maybe newfs current's root partition>
	<mount current's root partition on directory ${CURRENT_ROOT}>
	make installworld DESTDIR=${CURRENT_ROOT}
	cd src/etc; make distribution DESTDIR=${CURRENT_ROOT} # if newfs'd
	make installkernel KERNCONF=YOUR_KERNEL_HERE DESTDIR=${CURRENT_ROOT}
	cp /etc/fstab ${CURRENT_ROOT}/etc/fstab 		   # if newfs'd
	<edit ${CURRENT_ROOT}/etc/fstab to mount "/" from the correct partition>
	<reboot into current>
	<do a "native" rebuild/install as described in the previous section>
	<maybe install compatibility libraries from src/lib/compat>
 	<reboot>


	To upgrade in-place from 5.x-stable or higher to 6.x-stable
	-----------------------------------------------------------
	<make sure you have good level 0 dumps>
	make buildworld					[9]

	Make sure that you've read the UPDATING file to understand the
	tweaks to various things you need.  At this point in the life
	cycle of current, things change often and you are on your own
	to cope.  The defaults can also change, so please read ALL of
	the UPDATING entries.

	Also, if you are tracking -current, you must be subscribed to
	freebsd-current@freebsd.org.  Make sure that before you update
	your sources that you have read and understood all the recent
	messages there.  If in doubt, please track -stable which has
	much fewer pitfalls.

	[1] If you have third party modules, such as vmware, you
	should disable them at this point so they don't crash your
	system on reboot.

	[3] From the bootblocks, boot -s, and then do
		fsck -p
		mount -u /
		mount -a
		cd src
		adjkerntz -i		# if CMOS is wall time
	Also, when doing a major release upgrade, it is required that
	you boot into single user mode to do the installworld.

	[4] Note: This step is non-optional.  Failure to do this step
	can result in a significant reduction in the functionality of the
	system.  Attempting to do it by hand is not recommended and those
	that pursue this avenue should read this file carefully, as well
	as the archives of freebsd-current and freebsd-hackers mailing lists
	for potential gotchas.

	[5] Usually this step is a noop.  However, from time to time
	you may need to do this if you get unknown user in the following
	step.  It never hurts to do it all the time.

	[8] In order to have a kernel that can run the 5.x binaries
	needed to do an installworld, you must include the COMPAT_FREEBSD5
	option in your kernel.  Failure to do so may leave you with a system
	that is hard to boot to recover. A similar kernel option COMPAT_FREEBSD5
	is required to run the 5.x binaries on more recent kernels.

	Make sure that you merge any new devices from GENERIC since the
	last time you updated your kernel config file.

	[9] When checking out sources, you must include the -P flag to have
	cvs prune empty directories.

	If CPUTYPE is defined in your /etc/make.conf, make sure to use the
	"?=" instead of the "=" assignment operator, so that buildworld can
	override the CPUTYPE if it needs to.

	MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX must be defined in an environment variable, and
	not on the command line, or in /etc/make.conf.  buildworld will
	warn if it is improperly defined.
