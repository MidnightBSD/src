[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The [1mmailstats [22mutility displays the current mail statistics.

       First, the time at which statistics started being kept is displayed, in
       the format specified by ctime(3).  Then, the statistics for each mailer
       are  displayed  on  a  single line, each with the following white space
       separated fields:

              [1mM           [22mThe mailer number.
              [1mmsgsfr      [22mNumber of messages from the mailer.
              [1mbytes_from  [22mKbytes from the mailer.
              [1mmsgsto      [22mNumber of messages to the mailer.
              [1mbytes_to    [22mKbytes to the mailer.
              [1mmsgsrej     [22mNumber of messages rejected.
              [1mmsgsdis     [22mNumber of messages discarded.
              [1mmsgsqur     [22mNumber of messages quarantined.
              [1mMailer      [22mThe name of the mailer.

       After this display, a line totaling the values for all of  the  mailers
       is  displayed  (preceded  with  a  ``T''),  separated from the previous
       information by  a  line  containing  only  equals  (``='')  characters.
       Another line preceded with a ``C'' lists the number of TCP connections.

       The options are as follows:

       [1m-C     [22mRead the specified file instead of the default [1msendmail [22mconfigu-
              ration file.

       [1m-c     [22mTry  to use submit.cf instead of the default [1msendmail [22mconfigura-
              tion file.

       [1m-f     [22mRead the specified statistics file  instead  of  the  statistics
              file specified in the [1msendmail [22mconfiguration file.
