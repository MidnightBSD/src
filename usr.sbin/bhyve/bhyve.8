.Nd "run a guest operating system inside a virtual machine"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl aehAHPW
.Op Fl c Ar numcpus
.Op Fl g Ar gdbport
.Op Fl p Ar pinnedcpu
.Op Fl s Ar slot,emulation Ns Op , Ns Ar conf
.Op Fl S Ar slot,emulation Ns Op , Ns Ar conf
.Op Fl l Ar lpcdev Ns Op , Ns Ar conf
.Ar vmname
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is an experimental hypervisor that runs guest operating systems inside a
virtual machine.
.Pp
Parameters such as the number of virtual CPUs, amount of guest memory, and
I/O connectivity can be specified with command-line parameters.
.Pp
The guest operating system must be loaded with
.Xr bhyveload 4
or a similar boot loader before running
.Nm .
.Pp
.Nm
runs until the guest operating system reboots or an unhandled hypervisor
exit is detected.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width 10n
.It Fl a
Disallow use of the local APIC in X2APIC mode.
.It Fl A
Generate ACPI tables.
Required for
.Fx Ns /amd64
guests.
.It Fl c Ar numcpus
Number of guest virtual CPUs.
The default is 1 and the maximum is 16.
.It Fl H
Yield the virtual CPU thread when a HLT instruction is detected.
If this option is not specified, virtual CPUs will use 100% of a host CPU.
.It Fl g Ar gdbport
For
.Fx Ns /amd64 kernels compiled with
.Cd "option bvmdebug" ,
allow a remote kernel kgdb to be relayed to the guest kernel gdb stub
via a local IPv4 address and this port.
This option will be deprecated in a future version.
.It Fl p Ar pinnedcpu
Force guest virtual CPUs to be pinned to host CPUs.
Virtual CPU
.Em n
is pinned to host CPU
.Em pinnedcpu+n .
.It Fl P
Force the guest virtual CPU to exit when a PAUSE instruction is detected.
.It Fl W
Force virtio PCI device emulations to use MSI interrupts instead of MSI-X
interrupts.
.It Fl s Ar slot,emulation Ns Op , Ns Ar conf
Configure a virtual PCI slot and function.
.Pp
.Nm bhyve
provides PCI bus emulation and virtual devices that can be attached to
slots on the bus.
There are 32 available slots, with the option of providing up to 8 functions
per slot.
.Bl -tag -width 10n
.It Ar slot
.Ar pcislot Ns Op Ar :function
.Pp
The
.Ar pcislot
value is 0 to 31 and the optional function value is 0 to 7.
If not specified, the function value defaults to 0.
.It Ar emulation
.Bl -tag -width 10n
.It Li hostbridge | Li amd_hostbridge
.Pp
Provide a simple host bridge.
This is usually configured at slot 0, and is required by most guest
operating systems.
The
.Li amd_hostbridge
emulation is identical but uses a PCI vendor ID of
.Li AMD .
.It Li passthru
PCI pass-through device.
.It Li virtio-net
Virtio network interface.
.It Li virtio-block
Virtio block storage interface.
.It Li ahci-cd
AHCI controller attached to an ATAPI CD/DVD.
.It Li ahci-hd
AHCI controller attached to a SATA hard-drive.
.It Li uart
PCI 16550 serial device.
.It Li lpc
LPC PCI-ISA bridge with COM1 and COM2 16550 serial ports.
.El
.It Op Ar conf
This optional parameter describes the backend for device emulations.
If
.Ar conf
is not specified, the device emulation has no backend and can be
considered unconnected.
.Pp
Network devices:
.Bl -tag -width 10n
.It Ar tapN Ns Op , Ns Ar mac=xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx
.It Ar vmnetN Ns Op , Ns Ar mac=xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx
.Pp
If
.Ar mac
is not specified, the MAC address is derived from a fixed OUI and the
remaining bytes from an MD5 hash of the slot and function numbers and
the device name.
.Pp
The MAC address is an ASCII string in
.Xr ethers 5
format.
.El
.Pp
Block storage devices:
.Bl -tag -width 10n
.It Pa /filename Ns Oo , Ns Li nocache Oc Ns Oo , Ns Li direct Oc Ns Oo , Ns Li ro Oc
.It Pa /dev/xxx Ns Oo , Ns Ar nocache Oc Ns Oo , Ns Ar direct Oc Ns Oo , Ns Ar ro Oc
.Bl -tag -width 8n
.It Li nocache
Open the file with
.Dv O_DIRECT .
.It Li direct
Open the file using
.Dv O_SYNC .
.It Li ro
Force the file to be opened read-only.
.El
.Pp
The
.Li nocache ,
.Li direct ,
and
.Li ro
options are not available for virtio block devices.
.El
.Pp
TTY devices:
.Bl -tag -width 10n
.It Li stdio
Connect the serial port to the standard input and output of
the bhyve process.
.It Pa /dev/xxx
Use the host TTY device for serial port I/O.
.El
.Pp
Pass-through devices:
.Bl -tag -width 10n
.It Ns Ar slot Ns / Ns Ar bus Ns / Ns Ar function
Connect to a PCI device on the host at the selector described by
.Ar slot ,
.Ar bus ,
and
.Ar function
numbers.
.El
.Pp
The host device must have been reserved at boot-time using the
.Va pptdev
loader variable as described in
.Xr vmm 4 .
.El
.It Fl S Ar slot , Ns Ar emulation Ns Op , Ns Ar conf
Identical to the -s option except the device is instructed to use legacy
ISA addresses if possible.
Currently this only has an effect with the
.Li uart
device emulation.
This option will be deprecated in a future version.
.It Fl l Ar lpcdev Ns Op , Ns Ar conf
Allow devices behind the LPC PCI-ISA bridge to be configured.
The only supported devices are the TTY-class devices,
.Li com1
and
.Li com2 .
.It Fl m Ar size Ns Op Ar K|k|M|m|G|g|T|t
Guest physical memory size in bytes.
This must be the same size that was given to
.Xr bhyveload 8 .
.Pp
The size argument may be suffixed with one of K, M, G or T (either upper
or lower case) to indicate a multiple of kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes,
or terabytes.
If no suffix is given, the value is assumed to be in megabytes.
.It Fl e
Force
.Nm
to exit when a guest issues an access to an I/O port that is not emulated.
This is intended for debug purposes.
.It Fl h
Print help message and exit.
.It Ar vmname
Alphanumeric name of the guest.
This should be the same as that created by
.Xr bhyveload 8 .
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The guest operating system must have been loaded with
.Xr bhyveload 4
or a similar boot loader before
.Xr bhyve 4
can be run.
.Pp
To run a virtual machine with 1GB of memory, two virtual CPUs, a virtio
block device backed by the
.Pa /my/image
filesystem image, and a serial port for the console:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
bhyve -c 2 -s 0,hostbridge -s 1,lpc -s 2,virtio-blk,/my/image \\
  -l com1,stdio -A -H -P -m 1G vm1
.Ed
.Pp
Run a 24GB single-CPU virtual machine with three network ports, one of which
has a MAC address specified:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
bhyve -s 0,hostbridge -s 1,lpc -s 2:0,virtio-net,tap0 \\
  -s 2:1,virtio-net,tap1 \\
  -s 2:2,virtio-net,tap2,mac=00:be:fa:76:45:00 \\
  -s 3,virtio-blk,/my/image -l com1,stdio \\
  -A -H -P -m 24G bigvm
.Ed
.Pp
Run an 8GB quad-CPU virtual machine with 8 AHCI SATA disks, an AHCI ATAPI
CD-ROM, a single virtio network port, an AMD hostbridge, and the console
port connected to an
.Xr nmdm 4
null-model device.
