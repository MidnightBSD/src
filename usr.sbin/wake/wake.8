.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program is used to send Wake on LAN (WoL) frames over a local
Ethernet network to one or more hosts using their link layer (hardware)
addresses.
WoL functionality is generally enabled in a machine's BIOS
and can be used to power on machines from a remote system without
having physical access to them.
.Pp
.Ar interface
is the network interface of the local machine.
.Ar lladdr
are the link layer addresses of the remote machines
and can be specified as the actual hardware address
(six hexadecimal numbers separated by colons)
or a hostname entry in
.Pa /etc/ethers .
Link layer addresses can be determined and set on
.Mx
machines using
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
