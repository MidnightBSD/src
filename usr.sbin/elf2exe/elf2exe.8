.Sh NAME
.Nm elf2exe
.Nd convert Alpha ELF executable to AlphaBIOS / ARCS format
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar infile
.Ar outfile
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility
creates an executable that can be loaded by the AlphaBIOS or ARCS consoles
as found on systems designed for
.Tn Windows/NT .
The input file must have been
created as a non-relocatable standalone binary with a load address within
the memory range available for user programs (0x80000000 to 0x806fdfff
and 0x80900000 to at least 0x80ffffff).
.Pp
The command prints a list of sections found in the ELF executable and the
section sizes and offsets of the output file for diagnostic purposes.
.Pp
Given an object file
.Pa src.o
the following two commands will create a binary for ARCS:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ld -o a.out -M -N -Ttext 0x80900000 src.o
elf2exe a.out a.exe
.Ed
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility appeared in
.Fx 4.0 .
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
utility
does not even attempt to verify that the input file matches the requirements
for an ARC executable.
