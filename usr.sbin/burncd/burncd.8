.Sh NAME
.Nm burncd
.Nd control the ATAPI CD-R/RW driver
.Pp
This utility was
.Em deprecated
in
.Fx 9.0 .
See
.Sx NOTES .
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm

.Op Fl f Ar device
.Op Fl s Ar speed
.Op Ar command
.Op Ar command Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is used to burn CD-R/RW media using the ATAPI cd driver.
.Pp
Available options and operands:
.Bl -tag -width XXXXXXXXXXXX
.It Fl d
burn the CD-R/RW in DAO (disk at once) mode.
.It Fl e
eject the medium when done.
.It Fl f Ar device
set the device to use for the burning process.
.It Fl F
force operation regardless of warnings.
.It Fl l
read a list of image files from filename.
.It Fl m
close disk in multisession mode (otherwise disk is closed as singlesession).
.It Fl n
do not write gaps between data tracks in DAO mode.
.It Fl p
use preemphasis on audio tracks.
.It Fl q
quiet, do not print progress messages.
.It Fl s Ar speed
set the speed of the burner device.
Defaults to 4.
Specify
.Dq Li max
to use the drive's fastest speed.
.It Fl t
test write, do not actually write on the media.
.It Fl v
verbose, print extra progress messages.
.El
.Pp
.Ar command
may be one of:
.Bl -tag -width XXXXXXXXXXXX
.It Cm msinfo
Show the first LBA of the last track on the media
and the next writeable address on the media for use with the
.Xr mkisofs 8 Ns 's Pq Pa ports/sysutils/cdrtools
.Fl C
switch when adding additional data to ISO file systems with extra sessions.
.It Cm blank
Blank a CD-RW medium.
This uses the fast blanking method, so data are not physically overwritten,
only those areas that make the media appear blank for further usage are erased.
.It Cm eject
Eject the medium when done.
This is equivalent to the
.Fl e
option.
.It Cm erase
Erase a CD-RW medium.
This erases the entire media.
Can take up to 1 hour to finish.
.It Cm format Brq Cm dvd+rw | dvd-rw
Formats a DVD+RW or DVD-RW media to the default max size and 2048 byte blocks.
This operation can take a long time to finish.
Progress reporting is done during the process.
.It Cm fixate
Fixate the medium so that the TOC is generated and the media can be used
in an ordinary CD drive.
The driver defaults to creating singlesession media (see
.Fl m
option).
Ignored in DAO mode (see
.Fl d
option).
.It Cm raw | audio
Set the write mode to produce audio (raw mode) tracks for the following
images on the command line.
.It Cm data | mode1
Set the write mode to produce data (mode1) tracks for the following
image files
on the command line.
.It Cm mode2
Set the write mode to produce data (mode2) tracks for the following
image files
on the command line.
.It Cm XAmode1
Set the write mode to produce data (XAmode1) tracks for the following image
files on the command line.
.It Cm XAmode2
Set the write mode to produce data (XAmode2) tracks for the following image
files on the command line.
.It Cm vcd
Set the write mode to produce VCD/SVCD tracks for the following image files
on the command line.
This automatically sets DAO
.Pq Fl d
and
.Dq "no gaps"
.Pq Fl n
modes.
.It Cm dvdrw
Set the write mode to write a DVD+RW from the following image.
DVDs only have one track.
.It Ar file
All other arguments are treated as filenames of images to write to the media,
or in case the
.Fl l
option is used as files containing lists of images.
.El
.Pp
Files whose length are not a multiple of the current media blocksize are
quietly zero padded to fit the blocksize requirement.
The conventional filename
.Fl
refers to stdin, and can only be used once.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The following environment variables affect the execution of
.Nm :
.Bl -tag -width ".Ev BURNCD_SPEED"
.It Ev BURNCD_SPEED
The write speed to use if one is not specified with the
.Fl s
flag.
.It Ev CDROM
The CD device to use if one is not specified with the
.Fl f
flag.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width ".Pa /dev/acd0"
.It Pa /dev/acd0
The default device, if not overridden by the
.Ev CDROM
environment variable or the
.Fl f
option.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The typical usage for burning a data CD-R:
.Pp
.Dl "burncd -f /dev/acd0 data file1 fixate"
.Pp
The typical usage for burning an audio CD-R:
.Pp
.Dl "burncd -f /dev/acd0 audio file1 file2 file3 fixate"
.Pp
The typical usage for burning an audio CD-R in DAO mode:
.Pp
.Dl "burncd -f /dev/acd0 -d audio file1 file2 file3"
.Pp
The typical usage for burning a mixed mode CD-R:
.Pp
.Dl "burncd -f /dev/acd0 data file1 audio file2 file3 fixate"
.Pp
The typical usage for burning from a compressed image file on stdin:
.Pp
.Dl "gunzip -c file.iso.gz | burncd -f /dev/acd0 data - fixate"
.Pp
In the examples above, the files burned to data CD-Rs are assumed to
be ISO9660 file systems.
.Xr mkisofs 8 ,
available in the
.Fx
Ports Collection,
as part of the
.Pa sysutils/cdrtools
port, is commonly used to create ISO9660 file system images
from a given directory tree.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility appeared in
.Fx 4.0 .

.Nm
was deprecated in
.Fx 9.0 .

.Sh BUGS
Probably, please report when found.
.Sh NOTES
When
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "options ATA_CAM"
.Ed
.Pp
is compiled into the kernel, then
.Xr cdrecord 1 ,
available in the
.Fx
Ports Collection as part of the
.Pa sysutils/cdrtools
port, must be used instead.
