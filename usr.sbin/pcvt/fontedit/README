When I first saw this posted to rn, I tried to compile this on a machine 
running BSD UNIX.  Much to my dissapointment, It said "unable to find
/usr/include/termio.h" and thus it sat for a couple months.  I was able to
compile it on a 3b5, but I didn't have a vt220 hooked up to it.  I was doing
some unrelated work with ioctl calls and finally realized that it would not be
too hard to convert it from System V to BSD.  It also looked kind of strange
with the cursor on, so I turned this off.  To implement this, compile with
the "-DCURFIX" flag in the Makefile.  
I am working on a new version that uses curses and that would enable you to 
change the file that your are working on without leaving the program.  
I thought I'd post it as it is now, since it has a lot of uses right away.
Imagine changing your favorite game to have objects that look like what they 
are instead of the regular characters.  Also, I think people should post their
own character sets, if they come up with some neat stuff.
