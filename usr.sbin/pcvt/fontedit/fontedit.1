.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is used to edit the down line reloadable character set (DRCS) of a
.Tn VT220
terminal.
The editor has two display areas, one for displaying the
entry currently being manipulated, and one for displaying the complete
DRCS.
Commands to the editor take the form of function keys.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility
takes one command line parameter, a
.Ar file
name.
This file is used to save the character set.
If the file exists when
.Nm
is invoked, it is read in to initialize the DRCS.
The file is written to when
.Nm
exits.
