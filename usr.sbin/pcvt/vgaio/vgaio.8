.Sh NAME
.Nm vgaio
.Nd perform input/output on a Video Graphics Array
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl d
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Ss Purpose
The
.Nm
utility
is used to perform register-level input/output on a Video Graphics Array.
Since some of the sequences required to access those registers are very
silly,
.Nm
cares of all the things necessary and allows the user to access the
registers of several register groups with their symbolic names.
.Ss Options
.Bl -tag -width 10n -offset indent
.It Fl d
Turn on the grammar parser debugger.
.El
.Ss Command language
The command language of
.Nm
constitutes of some very simple tokens and rules.
Commands are executed
line by line as they are entered.
Each line may contain any number of
semicolon-separated input/output commands.
.Pp
Symbolic register names look like:
.Pp
.D1 Ao Em reggroup Ac Ns Aq Em regnumber
.Pp
with
.Aq Em regnumber
being any hexadecimal number
(without a leading
.Em 0x ) ,
and
.Aq Em reggroup
one of the strings
.Dq Em ar ,
.Dq Em cr ,
.Dq Em gr ,
.Dq Em mi ,
or
.Dq Em sr ,
standing for the
.Em Attribute controller ,
.Em CRT controller ,
.Em Graphics controller ,
.Em Miscellaneous Output Register ,
or
.Em Timing sequencer ,
respectively.
.Pp
An input instruction has the form
.Pp
.D1 Ao Em regname Ac \&?
.Pp
and will cause
.Nm
to output a line like
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Aq Em regname
.No = 0x Ns Aq Em number
.Ed
.Pp
An output instruction looks like
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Ao Em regname Ac =
.Aq Em number
.Ed
.Pp
Spaces or Tabs between the
.Aq Em reggroup ,
the
.Aq Em regnumber ,
or any of the other tokens are ignored.
They are not required anyway.
.Pp
The
.Dq Em mi
needs a single unused argument to satisfy the syntax :-) (-hm).
.Ss Access control
The caller must have uid 0 in order to gain the required access to
the IO registers.
.Sh HISTORY
This program is considered
.Dq hackware .
It has been developed in order to simplify the process of developing other
software that needs to program the Video Graphics Array.
.Pp
Remember, to use this program, your kernel has to be compiled with XSERVER
being defined!
