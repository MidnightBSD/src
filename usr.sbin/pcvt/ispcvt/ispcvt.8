.Sh NAME
.Nm ispcvt
.Nd verify if current video driver is pcvt driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl c
.Op Fl d Ar device
.Op Fl n
.Op Fl v
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility allows the user to check whether the current video driver compiled
into the kernel is a pcvt driver.
The major and minor release numbers of
the driver are also checked.
Furthermore
.Nm
is also able to print out the values of all the
.Dq Ar PCVT_XXXXXX
compile time options, the driver in the current running kernel was
compiled with.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
Specifies a device for which the check is done.
.It Fl v
Specifies being verbose.
On success the name and revision is reported, on
failure which comparison failed.
.It Fl n
print the number of compiled-in virtual terminals.
.It Fl c
This options prints out the values of all
.Dq Ar PCVT_XXXXXX
#defines which were given to the compiler at the time the currently running
kernel was compiled.
Specifying
.Fl v
with the
.Fl c
option gives a verbose listing of the compile-time options.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
utility exits with one of the following values:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width indent -compact
.It 0
driver is pcvt and major and minor numbers match
.It 1
.Xr open 2
or
.Xr ioctl 2
system call failed
.It 2
driver name mismatch
.It 3
name matched, release major number mismatch
.It 4
name and major number matched, release minor number mismatch
.It 5
usage error
