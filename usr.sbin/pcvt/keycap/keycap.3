.Sh NAME
.Nm kgetent ,
.Nm kgetnum ,
.Nm kgetflag ,
.Nm kgetstr
.Nd routines for accessing the keycap database
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Ft int
.Fn kgetent "char *bp" "char *name"
.Ft int
.Fn kgetnum "char *id"
.Ft int
.Fn kgetflag "char *id"
.Ft char *
.Fn kgetstr "char *id" "char **area"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions extract and use capabilities from a keyboard capability data
base, usually
.Pa /usr/share/misc/keycap.pcvt ,
the format of which is described in
.Xr keycap 5 .
.Pp
The
.Fn kgetent
function
extracts the entry for keyboard mapping
.Fa name
into the buffer at
.Fa bp .
The
.Fa bp
argument
should be a character buffer of size
1024 and must be retained through all subsequent calls to
.Fn kgetnum ,
.Fn kgetflag ,
and
.Fn kgetstr .
The
.Fn kgetent
function
returns \-1 if none of the
.Nm keycap
data base files could be opened,
0 if the map name given does not have an entry,
and 1 if all goes well.
.Pp
The
.Fn kgetnum
function
gets the numeric value of capability
.Fa id ,
returning \-1 if is not given for the map.
.Pp
The
.Fn kgetflag
function
returns 1 if the specified capability is present in
the map's entry, 0 if it is not.
.Pp
The
.Fn kgetstr
function
returns the string value of the capability
.Fa id ,
places it in the buffer at
.Fa area ,
and advances the
.Fa area
pointer.
The
.Fn kgetstr
function
returns
.Dv NULL
if the capability was not found.
