- The files "chardemo.vt" and "colors.vt" are taken from the MSDOS Kermit 
  distribution and are redistributed with permission from Frank da Cruz.

- cat chardemo.vt - displays all available character sets

- cat colors.vt   - displays all available back/foreground color combinations

- cat sgr.vt      - displays all possible graphic renditions

- all other files are some VT100 animations collected over the time from
  unkown sources, play them with playvt.

- Playvt is a program to play an animation file on pcvt: because pcvt is
  _much_ faster than an original VT100/VT220, it adds a programmable delay
  for each character so one can enjoy smooth-running animations! :-)
  There is no manpage available for playvt, just try to run playvt -? which
  should give sufficient information. You have to empirically find out which
  delay value fit's your needs!

have fun!
