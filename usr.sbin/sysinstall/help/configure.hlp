This menu allows you to configure your system after the installation
process is complete.  At the minimum, you should probably set the
system manager's password and the system time zone.

For extra goodies like bash, emacs, Pascal, etc., you should look at
the Packages item in this menu.

For setting the timezone after the system is installed, type
``tzsetup''.  For more information on the overall general system
configuration, see the ``/etc/defaults/rc.conf'' file.
