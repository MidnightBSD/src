This screen allows you to set up your general network parameters
(hostname, domain name, DNS server, etc) as well as the settings for a
given interface (which was selected from the menu before this screen).

PLIP/SLIP users - please read through to the end of this doc!

You can move through the fields with the TAB, BACK-TAB and ENTER
keys.  To edit a field, use DELETE or BACKSPACE.  You may also use ^A
(control-A) to go to the beginning of the line, ^E (control-E) to go
to the end, ^F (control-F) to go forward a character, ^B (control-B)
to go backward one character, ^D (control-D) to delete the character
under the cursor and ^K (control-K) to delete to the end of the line.
Basically, the standard EMACS motion sequences.

The "Extra options to ifconfig" field is kind of special (read: a
hack :-):

Any valid options to ifconfig can be specified here, so if you need
to do something "special" to get your interface working, then here
is the place to do it.

If you're running SLIP or PLIP, you also need to use it for specifying
the remote end of the link (simply type the foreign IP address in).
In the specific case where you're running PLIP with a Linux host peer
rather than a FreeBSD one, you also must add the "-link0" flag after the
foreign address.

If you're dealing with an ethernet adaptor with multiple media
connectors (e.g. AUI, 10BT, 10B2, etc), you can use this field to
specify which one to use.  Examples of valid strings include:

        "media 10base5/AUI" - Select the AUI port.
        "media 10baseT/UTP" - Select the twisted pair port.
        "media 10base2/BNC" - Select the BNC connector.
        "media 100baseTX"   - Select 100BaseT on a 100/10 dual adaptor.

If you have a wireless interface and must specify arguments such as a
WEP key here, you may use something like:

	"wepmode on wepkey 0xFEEDFACE"

When you're done with this form, select OK.
