.Sh NAME
.Nm sysinstall
.Nd system installation and configuration tool
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Ar var=value
.Op Ar function
.Op Ar ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is used for installing and configuring
.Fx
systems.
It is the first utility invoked by the
.Fx
installation boot
floppy and is also available as
.Pa /usr/sbin/sysinstall
on newly installed
.Fx
systems for use in later configuring the system.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility is generally invoked without arguments for the default
behavior, where the main installation/configuration menu is presented.
.Pp
On those occasions where it is deemed necessary to invoke a subsystem
of sysinstall directly, however, it is also possible to do so by
naming the appropriate function entry points on the command line.
Since this action is essentially identical to running an installation
script, each command-line argument corresponding to a line of script,
the reader is encouraged to read the section on scripting for more
information on this feature.
.Sh NOTES
The
.Nm
utility is essentially nothing more than a monolithic C program with
the ability to write MBRs and disk labels (through the services
of the
.Xr libdisk 3
library) and install distributions or packages onto new and
existing
.Fx
systems.
It also contains some extra intelligence
for running as a replacement for
.Xr init 8
when it is invoked by the
.Fx
installation boot procedure.
It
assumes very little in the way of additional utility support and
performs most file system operations by calling the relevant syscalls
(such as
.Xr mount 2 )
directly.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility currently uses the
.Xr dialog 3
library to do user interaction with simple ANSI line graphics, color
support for which is enabled by either running on a syscons VTY or some
other color-capable terminal emulator (newer versions of xterm will support
color when using the
.Dq xterm-color
termcap entry).
.Pp
This product is currently at the end of its life cycle and will
eventually be replaced.
.Sh RUNNING SCRIPTS
The
.Nm
utility may be either driven interactively through its various internal menus
or run in batch mode, driven by an external script.
Such a script may
be loaded and executed in one of 3 ways:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Sy "LOAD_CONFIG_FILE"
If
.Nm
is compiled with LOAD_CONFIG_FILE set in the environment
(or in the Makefile) to some value, then that value will
be used as the filename to automatically look for and load
when
.Nm
starts up and with no user interaction required.
This option is aimed primarily at large sites who wish to create a
single prototype install for multiple machines with largely identical
configurations and/or installation options.
.It Sy "MAIN MENU"
If
.Nm
is run interactively, that is to say in the default manner, it will
bring up a main menu which contains a "load config file" option.
Selecting this option will prompt for the name of a script file which
it then will attempt to load from a DOS or UFS formatted floppy.
.It Sy "COMMAND LINE"
Each command line argument is treated as a script directive
when
.Nm
is run in multi-user mode.
Execution ends either by explicit request
(e.g.\& calling the
.Ar shutdown
directive), upon reaching the end of the argument list or on error.
.Pp
For example:
.Bd -literal
/usr/sbin/sysinstall _ftpPath=ftp://ziggy/pub/ mediaSetFTP configPackages
.Ed
.Pp
Would initialize
.Nm
for FTP installation media (using the server `ziggy') and then
bring up the package installation editor, exiting when finished.
.El
.Sh SCRIPT SYNTAX
A script is a list of one or more directives, each directive taking
the form of:
.Pp
.Ar var=value
.Pp
.Ar function
.Pp
or
.Ar #somecomment
.Pp
Where
.Ar var=value
is the assignment of some internal
.Nm
variable, e.g.\& "ftpPass=FuNkYChiKn", and
.Ar function
is the name of an internal
.Nm
function, e.g.\& "mediaSetFTP", and
.Ar #comment
is a single-line comment for documentation purposes (ignored by
sysinstall).
Each directive must be by itself on a single line,
functions taking their arguments by examining known variable names.
This requires that you be sure to assign the relevant variables before
calling a function which requires them.
.Pp
The
.Ar noError
variable can be assigned before each directive: this will cause any error
detected while processing the directive itself to be ignored.
The value of
.Ar noError
will automatically reset to the default "unassigned" every time a directive is
processed.
.Pp
When and where a function depends on the settings of one or more variables
will be noted in the following table:
.Pp
.Sy "Function Glossary" :
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It configAnonFTP
Invoke the Anonymous FTP configuration menu.
.Pp
.Sy Variables :
None
.It configRouter
Select which routing daemon you wish to use, potentially
loading any required 3rd-party routing daemons as necessary.
.Pp
.Sy Variables :
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It router
can be set to the name of the desired routing daemon,
e.g.\&
.Dq routed
or
.Dq gated ,
otherwise it is prompted for.
.El
.It configNFSServer
Configure host as an NFS server.
.Pp
.Sy Variables :
None
.It configNTP
Configure host as a user of the Network Time Protocol.
.Pp
.Sy Variables :
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It ntpdate_hosts
Whitespace-separated list of
.Xr ntpdate 8
servers to sync from.
.El
.It configPCNFSD
Configure host to support PC NFS.
.Pp
.Sy Variables :
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It pcnfsd_pkg
The name of the PCNFSD package to load if necessary (defaults to hard coded
version).
.El
.It configPackages
Bring up the interactive package management menu.
.Pp
.Sy Variables :
None
.It configUsers
Add users and/or groups to the system.
.Pp
.Sy Variables :
None
.It diskPartitionEditor
Invokes the disk partition (MBR) editor.
.Pp
.Sy Variables :
.Bl -tag -width findx
.It geometry
The disk geometry, as a cyls/heads/sectors formatted string.
The word "sane" instructs
.Nm
to calculate a safe (not necessarily optimal) geometry if the
current one has more than 65535 cylinders, more than 256 heads or
more than 63 sectors per track (255 sectors on the PC98
architecture).
Default: no
change to geometry.
.It partition
Set to disk partitioning type or size, its value being
.Ar free
in order to use only remaining free space for
.Fx ,
.Ar all
to use the entire disk for
.Fx
but maintain a proper partition
table,
.Ar existing
to use an existing
.Fx
partition (first found),
.Ar exclusive
to use the disk in
.Dq dangerously dedicated
mode or, finally,
.Ar somenumber
to allocate
.Ar somenumber
blocks of available free space to a new
.Fx
partition.
Default: Interactive mode.
.It bootManager
is set to one of
.Ar boot
to signify the installation of a boot manager,
.Ar standard
to signify installation of a "standard" non-boot MGR DOS
MBR or
.Ar none
to indicate that no change to the boot manager is desired.
Default: none.
.It diskInteractive
If set, bring up the interactive disk partition editor.
.El
.Pp
Note: Nothing is actually written to disk by this function, an explicit call to
.Ar diskPartitionWrite
being required for that to happen.
.It diskPartitionWrite
Causes any pending MBR changes (typically from the
.Ar diskPartitionEditor
function) to be written out.
.Pp
.Sy Variables :
None
.It diskLabelEditor
Invokes the disk label editor.
This is a bit trickier from a script
since you need to essentially label everything inside each
.Fx
(type 0xA5) partition created by the
.Ar diskPartitionEditor
function, and that requires knowing a few rules about how things are
laid out.
When creating a script to automatically allocate disk space
and partition it up, it is suggested that you first perform the
installation interactively at least once and take careful notes as to
what the slice names will be, then and only then hardwiring them into
the script.
.Pp
For example, let's say you have a SCSI disk on which you have created a new
.Fx
partition in slice 2 (your DOS partition residing in slice 1).
The slice name would be
.Ar da0s2
for the whole
.Fx
partition
.Ar ( da0s1
being your DOS primary
partition).
Now let's further assume that you have 4GB in this
partition and you want to sub-partition that space into root, swap,
var and usr file systems for
.Fx .
Your invocation of the
.Ar diskLabelEditor
function might involve setting the following variables:
.Bl -tag -width findx
.It Li "da0s2-1=ufs 2097152 /"
A 1GB root file system (all sizes are in 512 byte blocks).
.It Li "da0s2-2=swap 1048576 /"
A 512MB swap partition.
.It Li "da0s2-3=ufs 524288 /var"
A 256MB /var file system.
.It Li "da0s2-4=ufs 0 /usr 1"
With the balance of free space (around 2.25GB) going to the /usr
file system and with soft-updates enabled (the argument following
the mount point, if non-zero, means to set the soft updates flag).
.El
.Pp
One can also use the
.Ar diskLabelEditor
for mounting or erasing existing partitions as well as creating new
ones.
Using the previous example again, let's say that we also wanted
to mount our DOS partition and make sure that an
.Pa /etc/fstab
entry is created for it in the new installation.
Before calling the
.Ar diskLabelEditor
function, we simply add an additional line:
.Pp
.Dl "da0s1=/dos_c N"
.Pp
before the call.
This tells the label editor that you want to mount
the first slice on
.Pa /dos_c
and not to attempt to newfs it (not that
.Nm
would attempt this for a DOS partition in any case, but it could just
as easily be an existing UFS partition being named here and the 2nd
field is non-optional).
.Pp
You can also set the
.Ar diskInteractive
variable to request that the disk label editor use an interactive dialog
to partition the disk instead of using variables to explicitly layout the
disk as described above.
.Pp
Note: No file system data is actually written to disk until an
explicit call to
.Ar diskLabelCommit
is made.
.It diskLabelCommit
Writes out all pending disklabel information and creates and/or mounts any
file systems which have requests pending from the
.Ar diskLabelEditor
function.
.Pp
.Sy Variables :
None
.It distReset
Resets all selected distributions to the empty set (no distributions selected).
.Pp
.Sy Variables :
None
.It distSetCustom
Allows the selection of a custom distribution set (e.g.\& not just one of the

.Sh DISTRIBUTION MEDIA
The following files can be used to affect the operation of
.Nm
when used during initial system installation.
.Bl -tag -width ".Pa packages/INDEX"
.It Pa cdrom.inf
A text file of properties, listed one per line, that describe the
contents of the media in use.
The syntax for each line is simply
.Dq Ar property No = Ar value .
Currently, only the following properties are recognized.
.Bl -tag -width ".Va CD_MACHINE_ARCH"
.It Va CD_VERSION
This property should be set to the
.Fx
version on the current
media volume.
For example,
.Dq Li "CD_VERSION = 5.3" .
.It Va CD_MACHINE_ARCH
This property should be set to the architecture of the contents on
this volume.
This property is normally only used with
.Fx
products that contain
CDs for different architectures, to provide better error messages if
users try to install packages built for the wrong architecture.
For example,
.Dq Li "CD_MACHINE_ARCH = amd64" .
.It Va CD_VOLUME
In a multi-volume collection (such as the
.Fx
4-CD set), the
.Pa ports/INDEX
file on each disc should contain the full package index for the set.
The last field of the
.Pa INDEX
file denotes which volume the package
appears on, and the
.Va CD_VOLUME
property here defines the volume ID of the current disc.
.El
.It Pa packages/INDEX
The package index file.
Each package is listed on a separate line with additional meta-data
such as the required dependencies.
This index is generated by
.Dq Li "make index"
from the
.Xr ports 7
collection.
When multi-volume support is enabled, an additional field should be
added to each line indicating which media volume contains the given
package.
.El

.Sh FILES
This utility may edit the contents of
.Pa /etc/rc.conf ,
.Pa /etc/hosts ,
and
.Pa /etc/resolv.conf
as necessary to reflect changes in the network configuration.
.Sh SEE ALSO
If you have a reasonably complete source tree online, take
a look at

.Sh BUGS
Editing slice and partition tables on disks which are currently mounted by
the system is not allowed.
This is generally only a problem when
.Nm
is run on a system that is already installed.
Use
.Xr fdisk 8
and
.Xr bsdlabel 8
for these tasks.
