.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command is used to create packages that will subsequently be fed to
one of the package extraction/info utilities.
The input description
and command line arguments for the creation of a package are not
meant to be human-generated, though it is easy enough to do so.
It is more expected that you will use a front-end tool for
the job rather than muddling through it yourself.
Nonetheless, a short
description of the input syntax is included in this document.
.Sh OPTIONS
The following command line options are supported:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl f Ar packinglist
Fetch
.Dq packing list
for package from the file
.Ar packinglist
or
.Cm stdin
if
.Ar packinglist
is a
.Cm -
(dash).
.It Fl c Xo
.Oo Fl Oc Ns Ar desc
.Xc
Fetch package
.Dq one line description
from file
.Ar desc
or, if preceded by
.Cm - ,
the argument itself.
This string should also
give some idea of which version of the product (if any) the package
represents.
.It Fl d Xo
.Oo Fl Oc Ns Ar desc
.Xc
Fetch long description for package from file
.Ar desc
or, if preceded by
.Cm - ,
the argument itself.
.It Fl Y , -yes
Assume a default answer of `Yes' for any questions asked.
.It Fl N , -no
Assume a default answer of `No' for any questions asked.
.It Fl O , -plist-only
Go into a `packing list Only' mode.
This is a custom hack for the
.Fx
.Em "Ports Collection"
and is used to do `fake pkg_add' operations when a port is installed.
In such cases, it is necessary to know what the final, adjusted packing
list will look like.
.It Fl v , -verbose
Turn on verbose output.
.It Fl h
Force tar to follow symbolic links, so that the files they point to
are dumped, rather than the links themselves.
.It Fl i Ar iscript
Set
.Ar iscript
to be the pre-install procedure for the package.
This can be any executable
program (or shell script).
It will be invoked automatically when the
package is later installed.
It will be passed the package's name as the
first argument.
.Pp
.Sy Note :
if the
.Fl I
option is not given, this script will serve as both the pre-install and the
post-install script for the package, differentiating between the
functionality by passing the keywords
.Ar PRE-INSTALL
and
.Ar POST-INSTALL
respectively, after the package's name.
.It Fl I Ar piscript
Set
.Ar piscript
to be the post-install procedure for the package.
This can be any
executable program (or shell script).
It will be invoked automatically
when the package is later installed.
It will be passed the package's name as
the first argument.
.It Fl C Ar conflicts
Set the initial package conflict list to
.Ar conflicts .
This is assumed to be a whitespace separated list of package names
and is meant as a convenient shorthand for specifying multiple
.Cm @conflicts
directives in the packing list (see PACKING LIST DETAILS section below).
.It Fl P Ar pkgs
Set the initial package dependency list to
.Ar pkgs .
This is assumed to be a whitespace separated list of package names
and is meant as a convenient shorthand for specifying multiple
.Cm @pkgdep
directives in the packing list (see
.Sx "PACKING LIST DETAILS"
section below).
Each argument from the
.Ar pkgs
list could be in the form
.Ar pkgname Ns Op : Ns Ar pkgorigin ,
where optional
.Ar pkgorigin
element denotes origin of each dependency from the list and it is
recorded into the packing list along with the
.Ar pkgname
using
.Cm @comment
directive.
.It Fl p , -prefix Ar prefix
Set
.Ar prefix
as the initial directory
.Dq base
to start from in selecting files for
the package.
.It Fl k Ar dscript
Set
.Ar dscript
to be the de-install procedure for the package.
This can be any executable
program (or shell script).
It will be invoked automatically when the
package is later (if ever) de-installed.
It will be passed the package's
name as the first argument.
.Pp
.Sy Note :
if the
.Fl K
option is not given, this script will serve as both the de-install and the
post-deinstall script for the package, differentiating between the
functionality by passing the keywords
.Ar DEINSTALL
and
.Ar POST-DEINSTALL
respectively, along with the package's name.
.It Fl K Ar pdscript
Set
.Ar pdscript
to be the post-deinstall procedure for the package.
This can be any
executable program (or shell script).
It will be invoked automatically when
the package is later de-installed.
It will be passed the package's name as
the first argument.
.It Fl r Ar rscript
Set
.Ar rscript
to be the
.Dq requirements
procedure for the package.
This can be any
executable program (or shell script).
It will be invoked automatically
at installation/deinstallation time to determine whether or not
installation/deinstallation should proceed.
To differentiate between installation and deinstallation, the keywords
.Ar INSTALL
and
.Ar DEINSTALL
are passed respectively, along with the package's name.
.It Fl s Ar srcdir
.Ar srcdir
will override the value of
.Cm @cwd
during package creation.
.It Fl S Ar basedir
.Ar basedir
will be prefixed to all
.Cm @cwd
during package creation.
.It Fl t , -template Ar template
Use
.Ar template
as the input to
.Xr mktemp 3 .
By default, this is the string
.Pa /tmp/instmp.XXXXXX ,
but it may be necessary to override it in the situation where
space in your
.Pa /tmp
directory is limited.
Be sure to leave some number of `X' characters
for
.Xr mktemp 3
to fill in with a unique ID.
.It Fl X Ar excludefile
Pass
.Ar excludefile
as a
.Fl exclude-from
argument to
.Cm tar
when creating final package.
See
.Cm tar
man page (or run
.Cm tar
with
.Fl -help
flag) for further information on using this flag.
.It Fl D Ar displayfile
Display the file (by concatenating it to stdout)
after installing the package.
Useful for things like
legal notices on almost-free software, etc.
.It Fl m Ar mtreefile
Run
.Xr mtree 8
with input from mtreefile before the package is installed.
Mtree is invoked as
.Cm mtree
.Fl u
.Fl f
.Ar mtreefile
.Fl d
.Fl e
.Fl p
.Pa prefix ,
where
.Pa prefix
is the name of the first directory named by a
.Cm @cwd
directive.
.It Fl o , -origin Ar originpath
Record an
.Ar originpath ,
as location of the port from which package has been created in the
.Fx
.Em "Ports Collection" .
It should be in the form
.Pa MASTERCATEGORY/PORTDIR .
.It Fl j
Use
.Xr bzip2 1
utility to compress package tarball instead of
.Xr gzip 1 .
Please note that this option is a NO-OP if the format of the resulting
archive is explicitly specified by the recognizable suffix of
.Ar pkg-filename .
Currently
.Nm
recognizes the following suffixes:
.Pa .tbz , .tgz, .txz
and
.Pa .tar .
.It Fl y
Compatibility synonym for
.Fl j .
.It Fl z
Use
.Xr gzip 1
utility to compress package tarball.
.It Fl J
Use
.Xr xz 1
utility to compress package tarball instead of
.Xr gzip 1 .
Please note that this option is a NO-OP if the format of the resulting
archive is explicitly specified by the recognizable suffix of
.Ar pkg-filename .
Currently
.Nm
recognizes the following suffixes:
.Pa .tbz , .tgz, .txz
and
.Pa .tar .
.It Fl b , -backup Ar pkg-name
Create package file from a locally installed package named
.Ar pkg-name .
If the
.Ar pkg-filename
is not specified, then resulting archive will be created in the
current directory and named
.Ar pkg-name
with an appropriate extraction suffix applied.
.It Fl R , -recursive
When creating package file from a locally installed package
also create package files for all packages required by
.Ar pkg-name .
Resulting archive(s) will be created in the current directory
and named using name of the respective package with appropriate
extraction suffix applied.
.It Fl x , -regex
Use basic regular expressions for
.Ar pkg-name .
.It Fl E , -extended
Use extended (modern) regular expressions for
.Ar pkg-name .
.It Fl G , -no-glob
Use exact matching for
.Ar pkg-name .
.It Fl n
Run in
.Dq no clobber
mode.
If a package tarball exists, the
.Nm
utility will not overwrite it.
This is useful, for example, when multiple packages are saved with
several consecutive runs of
.Nm
with the
.Fl Rb
options.
Saving common dependencies multiple times would do a lot of duplicate
work in this case.
The
.Fl n
option avoids repackaging common dependencies multiple times.
.El
.Sh PACKING LIST DETAILS
The
.Dq packing list
format (see
.Fl f )
is fairly simple, being
nothing more than a single column of filenames to include in the
package.
However, since absolute pathnames are generally a bad idea
for a package that could be installed potentially anywhere, there is
another method of specifying where things are supposed to go
and, optionally, what ownership and mode information they should be
installed with.
This is done by embedding specialized command sequences
in the packing list.
Briefly described, these sequences are:
.Bl -tag -width indent -compact
.It Cm @cwd Op Ar directory
Set the internal directory pointer to point to
.Ar directory .
All subsequent filenames will be assumed relative to this directory.
If no
.Ar directory
argument is given, it will set the internal directory pointer to the
first prefix value.
Note:
.Cm @cd
is also an alias for this command.
.It Cm @srcdir Ar directory
Set the internal directory pointer for _creation only_ to
.Ar directory .
That is to say that it overrides
.Cm @cwd
for package creation but not extraction.
.It Cm @exec Ar command
Execute
.Ar command
as part of the unpacking process.
If
.Ar command
contains any of the following sequences somewhere in it, they will
be expanded inline.
For the following examples, assume that
.Cm @cwd
is set to
.Pa /usr/local
and the last extracted file was
.Pa bin/emacs .
.Bl -tag -width indent -compact
.It Cm "%F"
Expands to the last filename extracted (as specified), in the example case
.Pa bin/emacs
.It Cm "\&%D"
Expand to the current directory prefix, as set with
.Cm @cwd ,
in the example case
.Pa /usr/local .
.It Cm "\&%B"
Expand to the
.Dq basename
of the fully qualified filename, that
is the current directory prefix, plus the last filespec, minus
the trailing filename.
In the example case, that would be
.Pa /usr/local/bin .
.It Cm "%f"
Expand to the
filename
part of the fully qualified name, or
the converse of
.Cm \&%B ,
being in the example case,
.Pa emacs .
.El
.It Cm @unexec Ar command
Execute
.Ar command
as part of the deinstallation process.
Expansion of special
.Cm %
sequences is the same as for
.Cm @exec .
This command is not executed during the package add, as
.Cm @exec
is, but rather when the package is deleted.
This is useful
for deleting links and other ancillary files that were created
as a result of adding the package, but not directly known to
the package's table of contents (and hence not automatically
removable).
The advantage of using
.Cm @unexec
over a deinstallation script is that you can use the
.Dq special sequence expansion
to get at files regardless of where they have
been potentially redirected (see
.Fl p ) .
.It Cm @mode Ar mode
Set default permission for all subsequently extracted files to
.Ar mode .
Format is the same as that used by the
.Cm chmod
command (well, considering that it is later handed off to it, that is
no surprise).
Use without an arg to set back to default (extraction)
permissions.
.It Cm @option Ar option
Set internal package options, the only two currently supported ones
being
.Ar extract-in-place ,
which tells the pkg_add command not to extract the package's tarball
into a staging area but rather directly into the target
hierarchy (this is typically meant to be used only by distributions
or other special package types), and
.Ar preserve ,
which tells pkg_add to move any existing files out of the way,
preserving the previous contents (which are also resurrected on
pkg_delete, so caveat emptor).
.It Cm @owner Ar user
Set default ownership for all subsequently extracted files to
.Ar user .
Use without an arg to set back to default (extraction)
ownership.
.It Cm @group Ar group
Set default group ownership for all subsequently extracted files to
.Ar group .
Use without an arg to set back to default (extraction)
group ownership.
.It Cm @comment Ar string
Imbed a comment in the packing list.
Useful in
trying to document some particularly hairy sequence that
may trip someone up later.
.It Cm @noinst Ar option Ar file
Specify that the package would have installed
.Pa file
if
.Pa option
had been specified at build time.
The action of
.Cm @noinst
is the same that
.Cm @comment
(which is doing nothing, it is just additional information).
.It Cm @ignore
Used internally to tell extraction to ignore the next file (do not
copy it anywhere), as it is used for some special purpose.
.It Cm @ignore_inst
Similar to
.Cm @ignore ,
but the ignoring of the next file is delayed one evaluation cycle.
This
makes it possible to use this directive in the
.Ar packinglist
file, so you can pack a
specialized datafile in with a distribution for your install script (or
something) yet have the installer ignore it.
.It Cm @name Ar name
Set the name of the package.
This is mandatory and is usually
put at the top.
This name is potentially different from the name of
the file it came in, and is used when keeping track of the package
for later deinstallation.
Note that
.Nm
will derive this field from the package name and add it automatically
if none is given.
.It Cm @dirrm Ar name
Declare directory
.Pa name
to be deleted at deinstall time.
By default, directories created by a
package installation are not deleted when the package is deinstalled;
this provides an explicit directory cleanup method.
This directive
should appear at the end of the package list.
If more than one
.Cm @dirrm
directives are used, the directories are removed in the order specified.
The
.Pa name
directory will not be removed unless it is empty.
.It Cm @mtree Ar name
Declare
.Pa name
as an
.Xr mtree 8
input file to be used at install time (see
.Fl m
above).
Only the first
.Cm @mtree
directive is honored.
.It Cm @display Ar name
Declare
.Pa name
as the file to be displayed at install time (see
.Fl D
above).
.It Cm @pkgdep Ar pkgname
Declare a dependency on the
.Ar pkgname
package.
The
.Ar pkgname
package must be installed before this package may be
installed, and this package must be deinstalled before the
.Ar pkgname
package is deinstalled.
Multiple
.Cm @pkgdep
directives may be used if the package depends on multiple other packages.
.It Cm @conflicts Ar pkgcflname
Declare a conflict with the
.Ar pkgcflname
package, as the two packages contain references to the same files,
and so cannot co-exist on the same system.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The environment variable
.Ev PKG_TMPDIR
names the directory where
.Nm
will attempt to create its temporary files.
If
.Ev PKG_TMPDIR
is not set,
the directory named by the contents of
.Ev TMPDIR
will be used.
If neither of
.Ev PKG_TMPDIR
and
.Ev TMPDIR
are set, the builtin defaults are used.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /usr/tmp -compact
.It Pa /var/tmp
Temporary directory if environmental variables
.Ev PKG_TMPDIR
and
.Ev TMPDIR
are not set.
.It Pa /tmp
The next choice if
.Pa /var/tmp
does not exist.
.It Pa /usr/tmp
The last choice if
.Pa /tmp
is unsuitable.

.Sh BUGS
Hard links between files in a distribution must be bracketed by
.Cm @cwd
directives in order to be preserved as hard links when the package is
extracted.
They additionally must not end up being split between
.Cm tar
invocations due to exec argument-space limitations (this depends on the
value returned by
.Fn sysconf _SC_ARG_MAX ) .
