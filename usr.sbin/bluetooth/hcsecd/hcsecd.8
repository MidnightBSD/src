.Nd control link keys and PIN codes for Bluetooth devices
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl dh
.Fl f Ar configfile
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
daemon controls link keys and PIN codes for Bluetooth devices.
It opens raw HCI socket and listens for the
.Dv Link_Key_Request ,
.Dv PIN_Code_Request
and
.Dv Link_Key_Notification
HCI events.
.Pp
Once
.Dv Link_Key_Request
or
.Dv PIN_Code_Request
HCI event is received, the daemon will
scan configuration file for matching entry.
The remote device BD_ADDR is used as a key.
If no matching entry was found, the default entry will be used.
If no default entry was found then it is assumed that no link key and no
PIN code exists.
For any given entry, link key takes precedence over PIN code.
If link key was not specified, it means device must generate link key from
PIN code.
If entry was found and the link key (or PIN code) exists then the
.Dv Link_Key_Request_Reply
(or
.Dv PIN_Code_Request_Reply )
command will be sent back to the device.
Otherwise, the
.Dv Link_Key_Request_Negative_Reply
(or
.Dv PIN_Code_Request_Negative_Reply )
command will be sent back to the device.
.Pp
The
.Nm
daemon also handles HCI
.Dv Link_Key_Notification
event and caches link keys created from the PIN codes in the memory.
To preserve link keys between restarts the
.Nm
daemon dumps link keys for all entries in the
.Pa /var/db/hcsecd.keys
link keys file.
If exists, the link keys file gets processed by
.Nm
daemon after it processes its main configuration file.
The link keys file gets written every time
.Nm
daemon is gracefully shutdown.
It is possible to force
.Nm
daemon to re-read its main configuration file and dump link keys file by sending
.Dv HUP
signal to the
.Nm
process.
User is not expected to modify link keys file by hand.
.Pp
The command line options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl d
Do not detach from the controlling terminal.
.It Fl f Ar configfile
Specify name of the configuration file.
The default is
.Pa /etc/bluetooth/hcsecd.conf .
.It Fl h
Display usage message and exit.

.Sh BUGS
Currently there is no way to select link key or PIN code based on which local
device received the request.
Everything is based on remote device BD_ADDR.
Also might implement interface for external helpers to obtain link keys and
PIN codes.
