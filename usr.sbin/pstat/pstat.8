.Sh NAME
.Nm pstat ,
.Nm swapinfo
.Nd display system data structures
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl Tfghkmnst
.Op Fl M Ar core Op Fl N Ar system
.Nm swapinfo
.Op Fl ghkm
.Op Fl M Ar core Op Fl N Ar system
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility displays open file entry, swap space utilization,
terminal state, and vnode data structures.
.Pp
If invoked as
.Nm swapinfo
the
.Fl s
option is implied, and only the
.Fl k , m , g ,
and
.Fl h
options are legal.
.Pp
If the
.Fl M
option is not specified, information is obtained from
the currently running kernel via the
.Xr sysctl 3
interface.
Otherwise, information is read from the specified core file,
using the name list from the specified kernel image (or from
the default image).
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl n
Print devices out by major/minor instead of name.
.It Fl h
.Dq Human-readable
output.
Use unit suffixes when printing swap partition sizes:
Byte, Kilobyte, Megabyte, Gigabyte, Terabyte and Petabyte.
.It Fl k
Print sizes in kilobytes, regardless of the setting of the
.Ev BLOCKSIZE
environment variable.
.It Fl m
Print sizes in megabytes, regardless of the setting of the
.Ev BLOCKSIZE
environment variable.
.It Fl g
Print sizes in gigabytes, regardless of the setting of the
.Ev BLOCKSIZE
environment variable.
.It Fl T
Print the number of used and free slots in several system tables.
This is useful for checking to see how large system tables have become
if the system is under heavy load.
.It Fl f
Print the open file table with these headings:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It LOC
The core location of this table entry.
.It TYPE
The type of object the file table entry points to.
.It FLG
Miscellaneous state variables encoded thus:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width indent -compact
.It R
open for reading
.It W
open for writing
.It A
open for appending
.It I
signal pgrp when data ready
.El
.It CNT
Number of processes that know this open file.
.It MSG
Number of messages outstanding for this file.
.It DATA
The location of the vnode table entry or socket structure for this file.
.It OFFSET
The file offset (see
.Xr lseek 2 ) .
.El
.It Fl s
Print information about swap space usage on all the
swap areas compiled into the kernel.
The first column is the device name of the partition.
The next column is
the total space available in the partition.
The
.Ar Used
column indicates the total blocks used so far; the
.Ar Available
column indicates how much space is remaining on each partition.
The
.Ar Capacity
reports the percentage of space used.
.Pp
If more than one partition is configured into the system, totals for all
of the statistics will be reported in the final line of the report.
.It Fl t
Print table for terminals
with these headings:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It LINE
Device name.
.It RAW
Number of characters in raw input queue.
.It CAN
Number of characters in canonicalized input queue.
.It OUT
Number of characters in output queue.
.It IHIWT
High water mark for input.
.It ILOWT
Low water mark for input.
.It OHWT
High water mark for output.
.It LWT
Low water mark for output.
.It COL
Calculated column position of terminal.
.It STATE
Miscellaneous state variables encoded thus:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width indent -compact
.It T
delay timeout in progress
.It W
waiting for open to complete
.It O
open
.It F
outq has been flushed during DMA
.It C
carrier is on
.It c
connection open
.It B
busy doing output
.It A
process is waiting for space in output queue
.It a
process is waiting for output to complete
.It X
open for exclusive use
.It S
output stopped (ixon flow control)
.It m
output stopped (carrier flow control)
.It o
output stopped (CTS flow control)
.It d
output stopped (DSR flow control)
.It K
input stopped
.It Y
send SIGIO for input events
.It D
state for lowercase
.Ql \e
work
.It E
within a
.Ql \e.../
for PRTRUB
.It L
next character is literal
.It P
retyping suspended input (PENDIN)
.It N
counting tab width, ignore FLUSHO
.It l
block mode input routine in use
.It s
i/o being snooped
.It Z
connection lost
.El
.It SESS
Kernel address of the session structure.
.It PGID
Process group for which this is the controlling terminal.
.It DISC
Line discipline;
.Ql term
for
TTYDISC
or
.Ql ntty
for
NTTYDISC
or
.Ql slip
for
SLIPDISC
or
.Ql ppp
for
PPPDISC.
.El
.It Fl M
Extract values associated with the name list from the specified core.
.It Fl N
If
.Fl M
is also specified,
extract the name list from the specified system instead of the default,
which is the kernel image the system has booted from.
