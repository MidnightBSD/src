.Nm ctm
.Nd source code mirror system
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
transfers data in a specific file format, called a CTM delta.
.Pp
CTM deltas consist of control lines and data chunks.
Each control
line starts with the letters
.Dq CTM ,
followed by a CTM statement and control data, and ends with a '\en'
character.
.Pp
Data chunks always belong to the preceding control line, and the
last field on that control line is the number of bytes in the data
chunk.
A trailing newline '\en' character follows each data chunk, this
newline is not part of the chunk and is not included in the count.
.Pp
The CTM statements are as follows.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It _BEGIN Ar version name number timestamp prefix
This is the overall begin of a CTM delta file.
The
.Ar version
field must match the program version
(currently 2.0).
.Ar Name
is the name and
.Ar number
the sequence number of the CTM service, it is matched against the file
.Pa .ctm_status
to see if the delta has already been applied.
.Ar Timestamp
contains the year, month, day, hour, minute, and second of the
time of delta creation for reference
(followed by the letter
.Sq Z
meaning this is a UTC timestamp).
The
.Ar prefix
field is currently not implemented.
.It _END Ar md5
This statement ends the CTM delta, the global
.Ar md5
checksum is matched against the MD5 checksum of the entire delta, up to
and including the space (0x20) character following ``_END''.
.It \&FM Ar name uid gid mode md5 count
Make the file
.Ar name ,
the original file had the uid
.Ar uid
(numerical, decimal),
the gid
.Ar gid
(numerical, decimal),
mode
.Ar mode
(numerical, octal),
and the MD5 checksum
.Ar md5 .
.Pp
The following
.Ar count
bytes data are the contents of the new file.
.It \&FS Ar name uid gid mode md5before md5after count
Substitute the contents of file
.Ar name ,
the original file had the new uid
.Ar uid
(numerical, decimal),
the new gid
.Ar gid
(numerical, decimal),
new mode
.Ar mode
(numerical, octal),
the old MD5 checksum
.Ar md5before ,
and the new MD5 checksum
.Ar md5after .
.Pp
The following
.Ar count
bytes data are the contents of the new file.
.Pp
File substitution is used if the commands to edit a file would exceed
the total file length, so substituting it is more efficient.
.It \&FN Ar name uid gid mode md5before md5after count
Edit the file
.Ar name .
The arguments are as above, but the data sections contains an
.Xr diff 1
-n script which should be applied to the file in question.
.It \&FR Ar name md5
Remove the file
.Ar name ,
which must match the MD5 checksum
.Ar md5 .
.It \&AS Ar name uid gid mode
The original file
.Ar name
changed its owner to
.Ar uid ,
its group to
.Ar gid ,
and/or its mode to
.Ar mode .
.It \&DM Ar name uid gid mode
The directory
.Ar name
is to be created, it had originally the owner
.Ar uid ,
group
.Ar gid ,
and mode
.Ar mode .
.It \&DR Ar name
The directory
.Ar name
is to be removed.
