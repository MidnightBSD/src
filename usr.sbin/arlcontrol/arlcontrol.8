.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility controls the operation of Aironet Arlan 655 wireless networking
devices via the
.Xr arl 4
driver.
Most of the parameters that can be changed are related to the
Aironet protocol which the Aironet Arlan 655 card implements.
The
.Nm
utility can also be used to view the current NIC status, configuration,
and to dump out the values of the card's statistics counters.
.Pp
The
.Ar iface
argument given to
.Nm
should be the logical interface name associated with the Aironet Arlan 655
device
.Li ( arl0 , arl1 ,
etc.) and must be specified.
.Sh OPTIONS
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ar iface
Display current settings of the specified wireless interface.
This retrieves current card settings from the driver and prints
them out.
.It Ar iface Cm country Ar country Pq Cm 9 Ns - Ns Cm 15

.El
.It Ar iface Cm priority Ar priority Pq Cm normal , high , highest
Use the
.Ar priority
parameter to set the priority of the Arlan 655 Radio Media Access Control
the values are
.Cm normal , high
or
.Cm highest .
The higher the priority is set, the more likely this unit will be the first
to successfully transmit a packet when multiple units are trying
to transmit at the same time.
.Pp
The percentage of units on your network that you set to values other than
.Cm normal
should be kept small - 10 percent or less.
.It Ar iface Cm txretry Ar txretry
Set transmit retries.
Default is 0.
.It Ar iface Cm stat
Print internal Arlan 655 statistics block.
.It Ar iface Cm quality
Display the cached signal level and quality maintained by the
.Xr arl 4
driver.
The driver retains information about quality and level for packets
received from different hosts.
Also the driver extracts values from ACK packets.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Bd -literal -offset indent
arlcontrol arl0 country 11 priority high
arlcontrol arl0 quality
arlcontrol arl0 stat
arlcontrol arl0
.Ed
.Pp
You can configure the Arlan 655 card from
.Pa /etc/start_if.arl0 .
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
#!/bin/sh
/usr/sbin/arlcontrol country 9 priority highest
