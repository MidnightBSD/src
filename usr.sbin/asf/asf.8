.Sh NAME
.Nm asf
.Nd add symbol files
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl afksx
.Op Ar modules-path Op Ar outfile
.Sh DESCRIPTION
By default,
.Nm
reads
.Xr kldstat 8
output from standard input and writes to standard output a list of
.Xr gdb 1
commands to add symbol files from KLDs in subdirectories of the subdirectory
.Pa modules
of the current directory, which is intended to be a kernel build directory.
This allows
.Xr gdb 1
to load the symbols into the debugging environment.
.Pp
If
.Ar modules-path
is specified,
.Nm
uses it for the modules directory instead of the default
.Pa modules .
This is useful when building in a non-standard location (i.e., not
.Pa /usr/src
and
.Pa /usr/obj ) .
.Pp
If
.Ar outfile
is specified,
.Nm
writes to it instead of standard output.
.Sh OPTIONS
The following options modify the function of
.Nm :
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl a
When writing to an explicit
.Ar outfile ,
append to the file rather than overwriting it.
.It Fl f
Instead of trying to simplistically guess the path for each module, perform
a traversal in the same way that
.Xr find 1
does to locate an exact path for each module, no matter where in
.Ar modules-path
it is located.
.It Fl k
Instead of reading from standard input, start a
.Xr kldstat 8
and read the information from it.
.It Fl s
Do not prepend a (guessed) subdirectory of the module path.
.It Fl x
Normally
.Nm
looks for KLDs with names of the form
.Ao Ar module Ac Ns Pa .ko.debug .
The
.Fl x
option tells
.Nm
to look for KLDs with names of the form
.Ao Ar module Ac Ns Pa .ko .
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr gdb 1 ,
.Xr kldstat 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility first appeared in
.Fx 5.2 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An Greg Lehey Aq grog@FreeBSD.org
.Sh BUGS
It should be possible to write to an
.Ar outfile
without specifying a module path.
