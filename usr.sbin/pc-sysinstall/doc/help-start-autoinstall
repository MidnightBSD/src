start-autoinstall - HELP
-----------------------------------------------

About:
	start-autoinstall is used when performing automated installationsr. It is able
	to configure networking with provided settings, and fetch an installation script from
	http / ftp server. This allows media to be created which fetches dynamic configuration
	options from a server-side supplier. 

Usage:
	pc-sysinstall start-autoinstall <config>

Config Syntax:

	The configuration file for start-autoinstall can contain the following options:

	pc_config: <value>
		- Location of the pc-sysinstall installation configuration file, can be local
		  or start with http:// or ftp:// to fetch from a remote system. 

     shutdown_cmd: <value>
		- Command to execute post-installation, such as "shutdown -p now" or other.

  confirm_install: (YES/NO)
		- Prompt on the console to begin installation. Defaults to YES.
		  Warning: Setting this to NO will start an installation as soon as start-autoinstall
		  is run. (I.E. after booting some install media) It may be dangerous if a disk is left
		  in a drive and the system is turned on!

       nic_config: (DHCP-ALL / <cfg>)
		- When set to DHCP-ALL, the software will attempt to get a network address from DHCP on
		  any / all detected NICS. If set to some other command, it will be used as an argument
		  to "ifconfig" to enable networking.

		- Use the following DNS server for networking
