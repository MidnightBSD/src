.Dt RDATE 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm rdate
.Nd set the system's date from a remote host
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm rdate
.Op Fl 46acnpsv
.Ar host
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
displays and sets the local date and time from the
host name or address given as the argument.
The time source may be an RFC 868 TCP protocol server,
which is usually implemented as a built-in service of
.Xr inetd 8 ,
or an RFC 2030 protocol SNTP/NTP server.
By default,
.Nm
uses the RFC 868 TCP protocol.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl 4
Forces
.Nm
to use IPv4 addresses only.
.It Fl 6
Forces
.Nm
to use IPv6 addresses only.
.It Fl a
Use the
.Xr adjtime 2
call to gradually skew the local time to the
remote time rather than just hopping.
.It Fl c
Correct leap seconds.
Sometimes required when synchronizing to an NTP server.
When synchronizing using the RFC 868 protocol, use this option only if the
server does not correctly account for leap seconds.
You can determine if you need this parameter if you sync against an NTP
server (with this parameter) or (recommended) check with a local radio
controlled watch or phone service.
.It Fl n
Use SNTP (RFC 2030) instead of the RFC 868 time protocol.
.It Fl p
Do not set, just print the remote time.
.It Fl s
Do not print the time.
.It Fl v
Verbose output.
Always show the adjustment.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /var/log/wtmp -compact
.It Pa /var/log/wtmp
record of date resets and time changes
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
To get the legal time in Germany, set the
.Pa /etc/localtime
symlink to
.Pa /usr/share/zoneinfo/right/Europe/Berlin
and issue the following command:
.Pp
.D1 Li "# rdate -ncv ptbtime1.ptb.de"
.Pp
The command of course assumes you have a working internet connection
and DNS set up to connect to the server at
.Sy Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt
in Braunschweig, Germany.
.Pp
To gradually adjust time once an hour after the first
.Qq step
adjustment, put the following line into root's crontab:
.Pp
.D1 Li "58  *  *  *  *  rdate -ncav ptbtime1.ptb.de | logger -t NTP"
