.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility allows to mount volume from a NetWare server.
It may use either
existing connection or create new: if no usable connection was found
it will try to establish a new one.
Connection has count of references to it,
so when last mount will be dismounted connection will be closed.
It is
possible to create connection without any mounts (but use it for them) with
.Xr ncplogin 1 .
.Pp
Note two forms of command line.
In the first form, server and user specified
via
.Fl S
and
.Fl U
options respectively.
In the second form server and user specified in
.Ar special
part of
.Xr mount 8
command line arguments (the
.Fl S ,
.Fl U
and
.Fl V
options are not used in this case).
This allows use of
.Xr fstab 5
file (see
.Sx EXAMPLES
below).
.Pp
The options are:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl S Ar server
Name of NetWare server to connect.
For native IP you will need also
.Fl A
option.
.It Fl U Ar user
Name of user used in login sequence.
.It Fl connection\ options
See
.Xr ncplogin 1
for details.
.It Fl V Ar volume
Volume name to mount.
Volume name can also be specified after all options and
before
.Ar mount-point .
.It Ar node
Path to mount volume.
.It Fl c Ar case
Select a
.Ar case
option which affects on name representation.
.Ar Case
can be one of the following:
.Bl -tag -width "ValueXX"
.It Em Value
.Em Meaning
.It l
All existing file names converted to lower case.
Newly created file gets a lower case under OS2 name space.
This is the default when mounting volumes with DOS name space.
.It L
Same as 'l' but file system tries to be case insensitive.
May not work well.
.It n
No case conversion is performed.
.Em Warning !
Use this option with DOS name space only as a last resort,
because creating a lower case name in the DOS name space
can lead to unpredictable results.
This is the default when mounting volumes with OS2 name space.
.It u
All existing file names converted to upper case.
Newly created file gets an upper case under OS2 name space.
.It U
Same as 'u' but file system tries to be case insensitive.
May not work well.
.El
.It Fl f Ar mode , Fl d Ar mode
Specify permissions that should be assigned to files and directories.
The values must be specified as octal numbers.
Default value for the file mode
is taken from mount point, default value for the dir mode adds execute
permission where the file mode gives read permission.
.Pp
Note that these permissions can differ from the rights granted by NetWare
server.
.It Fl n Ar namespace
Do not use
.Ar namespace .
Currently only
.Ar OS2
can be here.
.It Fl v
Print version number.
.It Fl u Ar uid , Fl g Ar gid
User id and group id assigned to files.
The default is owner and group id from
directory where volume is mounted.
.It Fl l Ar locale
Set the locale for case conversion.
By default
.Nm
tries to use an environment variable
.Ev LC_* .
.It Fl w Ar scheme
Select a
.Ar scheme
used to convert file names between NetWare and
.Fx .
Supported conversion schemes are:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm koi2cp866"
.It Cm asis
Characters passed as is without any alteration.
.It Cm koi2cp866
koi8-r <-> CP866
.It Cm se
Suits for setups used in Sweden.
.El
.It Fl M Ar mode
See
.Xr ncplogin 1
for details.
If this option is omitted, connection permissions
assumed the same as directory mode
.Pq Fl d
option.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /var/log/wtmp -compact
.It Pa ~/.nwfsrc
keeps static parameters for connections and other information.
See
.Pa /usr/share/examples/nwclient/dot.nwfsrc
for details.
.El
.Sh NOTES
Before any NCP connection can be established kernel must be configured
for IPX support, IPXrouted and KLD nwfs.ko should be loaded.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Next examples illustrates how to connect to NetWare server
.Em nwserv
as user
.Em GUEST
and mount volumes
.Em SYS
and
.Em VOL1 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
mount_nwfs -S nwserv -U guest -V sys /nw/s1/sys
mount_nwfs /nwserv:guest/sys /nw/s1/sys
mount -t nwfs /nwserv:guest/vol1 /nw/s1/vol1
mount -t nwfs /nwserv:boris/sys/home/boris /home/boris/nw/home
.Ed
.Pp
The last example mounts only subdirectory on a volume and equivalent
to NetWare 'map root' command.
.Pp
It is possible to use
.Xr fstab 5
for nwfs mounts:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
/nwserv:guest/sys       /nw/s1/sys     nwfs  rw,noauto 0   0
/nwserv:guest/vol1      /nw/s1/vol2    nwfs  rw,noauto 0   0
