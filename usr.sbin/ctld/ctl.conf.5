.Sh NAME
.Nm ctl.conf
.Nd CAM Target Layer / iSCSI target daemon configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
configuration file is used by the
.Xr ctld 8
daemon.
Lines starting with
.Ql #
and empty lines are interpreted as comments.
The general syntax of the
.Nm
file is:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
pidfile <path>

auth-group <name> {
	chap <user> <secret>
	...
}

portal-group <name> {
	listen <address>
	listen-iser <address>
	discovery-auth-group <name>
	...
}

target <name> {
	auth-group <name>
	portal-group <name>
	lun <number> {
		path <path>
	}
	...
}
.Ed
.Ss global level
The following statements are available at the global level:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ic auth-group Aq Ar name
Opens an auth-group section, defining an authentication group,
which can then be assigned to any number of targets.
.It Ic debug Aq Ar level
Specifies debug level.
The default is 0.
.It Ic maxproc Aq Ar number
Specifies limit for concurrently running child processes handling
incoming connections.
The default is 30.
Setting it to 0 disables the limit.
.It Ic pidfile Aq Ar path
Specifies path to pidfile.
The default is
.Pa /var/run/ctld.pid .
.It Ic portal-group Aq Ar name
Opens a portal-group section, defining a portal group,
which can then be assigned to any number of targets.
.It Ic target Aq Ar name
Opens a target configuration section.
.It Ic timeout Aq Ar seconds
Specifies timeout for login session, after which the connection
will be forcibly terminated.
The default is 60.
Setting it to 0 disables the timeout.
.El
.Ss auth-group level
The following statements are available at the auth-group level:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ic chap Ao Ar user Ac Aq Ar secret
Specifies CHAP authentication credentials.
.It Ic chap-mutual Ao Ar user Ac Ao Ar secret Ac Ao Ar mutualuser Ac Aq Ar mutualsecret
Specifies mutual CHAP authentication credentials.
Note that for any auth-group, configuration may contain either chap,
or chap-mutual entries; it's an error to mix them.
.El
.Ss portal-group level
The following statements are available at the portal-group level:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ic discovery-auth-group Aq Ar name
Assigns previously defined authentication group to that portal group,
to be used for target discovery.
By default, the discovery will be denied.
A special auth-group, "no-authentication", may be used to allow for discovery
without authentication.
.It Ic listen Aq Ar address
Specifies IPv4 or IPv6 address and port to listen on for incoming connections.
.It Ic listen-iser Aq Ar address
Specifies IPv4 or IPv6 address and port to listen on for incoming connections
using iSER (iSCSI over RDMA) protocol.
.El
.Ss target level:
The following statements are available at the target level:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ic alias Aq Ar text
Assigns human-readable description to that target.
There is no default.
.It Ic auth-group Aq Ar name
Assigns previously defined authentication group to that target.
There is no default; every target must use either auth-group,
or chap, or chap-mutual statements.
A special auth-group, "no-authentication", may be used to permit access
without authentication.
.It Ic chap Ao Ar user Ac Aq Ar secret
Specifies CHAP authentication credentials.
Note that targets must use either auth-group, or chap,
or chap-mutual clauses; it's a configuration error to mix them in one target.
.It Ic chap-mutual Ao Ar user Ac Ao Ar secret Ac Ao Ar mutualuser Ac Aq Ar mutualsecret
Specifies mutual CHAP authentication credentials.
Note that targets must use either auth-group, chap, or
chap-mutual clauses; it's a configuration error to mix them in one target.
.It Ic portal-group Aq Ar name
Assigns previously defined portal group to that target.
Default portal group is "default", which makes the target available
on TCP port 3260 on all configured IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
.It Ic lun Aq Ar number
Opens a lun configuration section, defining LUN exported by a target.
.El
.Ss lun level
The following statements are available at the lun level:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ic backend Ao Ar block | Ar ramdisk Ac
Specifies the CTL backend to use for a given LUN.
Valid choices are
.Dq block
and
.Dq ramdisk ;
block is used for LUNs backed
by files in the filesystem; ramdisk is a bitsink device, used mostly for
testing.
The default backend is block.
.It Ic blocksize Aq Ar size
Specifies blocksize visible to the initiator.
The default blocksize is 512.
.It Ic device-id Aq Ar string
Specifies SCSI Device Identification string presented to the initiator.
.It Ic option Ao Ar name Ac Aq Ar value
Specifies CTL-specific options passed to the kernel.
.It Ic path Aq Ar path
Specifies path to file used to back the LUN.
.It Ic serial Aq Ar string
Specifies SCSI serial number presented to the initiator.
.It Ic size Aq Ar size
Specifies LUN size, in bytes.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width ".Pa /etc/ctl.conf" -compact
.It Pa /etc/ctl.conf
The default location of the
.Xr ctld 8
configuration file.
