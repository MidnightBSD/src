.Sh NAME
.Nm sade
.Nd sysadmins disk editor
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is used for various disk administration tasks on
.Fx
systems.
.Pp
It is generally invoked without arguments for the default
behavior, where the main menu is presented.
.Sh NOTES
The
.Nm
utility aims to provide a handy tool for disk management
tasks on an already installed system.
The goal is to save
some of the useful functionality of the old
.Xr sysinstall 8
which
will be removed from the system in favor of the new installer.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr sysinstall 8
.Sh HISTORY
This version of
.Nm
first appeared in
.Fx 6.3 .
The code is extracted from the
.Xr sysinstall 8
utility.
.Sh AUTHORS
.An Jordan K. Hubbard Aq jkh@FreeBSD.org
.Sh BUGS
The utility misses a lot of nice features, such as tools for
manipulating
.Xr gmirror 8
or
.Xr gvinum 8
stuff.
These will be added later.
