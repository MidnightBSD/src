.Sh NAME
.Nm sensorsd
.Nd "hardware sensors monitor"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl d
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility retrieves sensor monitoring data like fan speed,
temperature, voltage and
.Xr ami 4
logical disk status via
.Xr sysctl 3 .
When the state of any monitored sensor changes, an alert is sent using
.Xr syslog 3
and a command, if specified, is executed.
.Pp
By default,
.Nm
monitors status changes on all sensors that keep their state,
thus sensors that automatically provide status do not require
any additional configuration.
In addition, for every sensor,
no matter whether it automatically provides its state or not,
custom low and high limits may be set,
so that a local notion of sensor status can be computed by
.Nm ,
indicating whether the sensor is within or is exceeding its limits.
.Pp
Limit and command values for a particular sensor may be specified in the
.Xr sensorsd.conf 5
configuration file.
This file is reloaded upon receiving
.Dv SIGHUP .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl d
Do not daemonize.
If this option is specified,
.Nm
will run in the foreground.

.Xr syslogd 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
program first appeared in
.Ox 3.5 .
.Sh CAVEATS
Certain sensors may flip status from time to time.
To guard against false reports,
.Nm
implements a state dumping mechanism.
However, this inevitably introduces
an additional delay in status reporting and command execution,
e.g.\& one may notice that
.Nm
makes its initial report about the state of monitored sensors
not immediately, but either 1 or 2 minutes after it is being started up.
