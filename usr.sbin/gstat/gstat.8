.Sh NAME
.Nm gstat
.Nd print statistics about GEOM disks
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl acd
.Op Fl f Ar filter
.Op Fl I Ar interval
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility can be used to monitor I/O transactions of
.Xr geom 4
devices.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl a
Only display providers that are at least 0.1% busy.
.It Fl c
Enable display of
.Xr geom 4
consumers too.
The default is to show statistics only for
.Xr geom 4
producers.
.It Fl d
Enable display of statistics for delete
.Pq Dv BIO_DELETE
operations.
.It Fl f Ar filter
A regular expression that can be used to only show statistics for some
devices.
Only devices with the names matching
.Ar filter
will be displayed.
The format of the regular expression is described in
.Xr re_format 7 .
.It Fl I Ar interval
Refresh the
.Nm
display every
.Ar interval
microseconds.
Adding a suffix of
.Cm s , ms ,
or
.Cm us
(the default) indicates that the update interval is specified in
seconds, milliseconds, or microseconds, respectively.

.Ex -std

.Xr geom 4 ,
.Xr iostat 8 ,
.Xr vmstat 8
.Sh HISTORY
A
.Nm
utility appeared in
.Fx 5.0 .
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
utility only works interactively.
It should probably detect when it is run non-interactively and produce
simple
.Tn ASCII
text output.
Otherwise, this utility should probably be folded into
.Xr systat 1
which only works interactively and is the obvious utility to run for
various other forms of system statistics.
