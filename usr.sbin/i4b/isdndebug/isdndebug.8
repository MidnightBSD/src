.Sh NAME
.Nm isdndebug
.Nd display and control isdn4bsd kernel variables and statistics
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl c
.Op Fl e
.Op Fl g
.Op Fl l Ar layer
.Op Fl m
.Op Fl q
.Op Fl r
.Op Fl s Ar value
.Op Fl u Ar unit
.Op Fl z
.Op Fl C
.Op Fl Q
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is part of the isdn4bsd package and is used to control the level of
debugging output of the isdn4bsd kernel part.
Every layer of the isdn4bsd kernel uses a debugging mask which can be
manipulated using this utility.
.Pp
A second usage of
.Nm
is to display and reset chipset specific statistics and/or error counters
and to display and reset the D-channel layer 2
(Q.921 LAPD protocol) statistics and error counters.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c
Display chipset specific statistics and/or error counters.
.It Fl e
Set debugging mask for the selected layer(s) to display errors only.
.It Fl g
Get the debugging mask for the selected layer(s).
.It Fl l
Specify the layer for which a command applies.
Default is all layers.
.It Fl m
Set debugging mask for the selected layer(s) to display all possible
debugging messages (maximum output).
.It Fl q
Display the Q.921 (D-channel layer 2) frame receive/transmit statistics.
.It Fl r
Set debugging mask for the selected layer(s) to the compiled in default
(reset).
.It Fl s
Set debugging mask for the selected layer(s) to value.
Value can be
specified in any number base supported by
.Xr sscanf 3 .
.It Fl u
Set the unit numbers for the -c, -q, -C and -Q flags.
.It Fl z
Set debugging mask for the selected layer(s) to no output at all (zero).
.It Fl H
Reset the chipset specific statistics and/or error counters to zero.
.It Fl Q
Reset the Q.921 (D-channel layer 2) frame receive/transmit statistics to zero.

/dev/i4bctl
.Sh EXAMPLES
The command:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
isdndebug -g
.Ed
.Pp
displays the current debugging level for all ISDN layers
