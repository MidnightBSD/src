.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl c Ar unit
.Op Fl d Ar level
.Op Fl i Ar number
.Op Fl h
.Op Fl o Ar number
.Op Fl t Ar num
.Op Fl w
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is part of the isdn4bsd package and may be used as a stimulation tool
for debugging the isdn4bsd kernel functionality.
.Pp
NOTE:
The
.Nm
utility must be run
.Em instead
of the
.Xr isdnd 8
daemon and cannot be used while the daemon runs.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c
Use controller unit number for test.
.It Fl d
Set the debugging level
.It Fl h
Use HDLC as the B channel layer 1 protocol instead of no protocol.
.It Fl i
Use number to verify the incoming number.
.It Fl o
Use number as the outgoing number to dial.
.It Fl t
Set number of times the test pattern on the B-channel is exchanged
.It Fl w
Wait for keyboard input for terminating the call.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility is currently of not much use for end users, it is primarily a debugging
tool for development and is part of the release in the hope, that someone
enhances it as a real self test and setup-verification tool!
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility does almost no error checking and error recovery, so unexpected
hangs or crashes may occur.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Pa /dev/i4b
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
For the following example, it is assumed that a machine with isdn4bsd
installed is connected to an S0 bus and that one of the valid MSN's (MSN = Multiple Subscriber Number
= telephone number) on this bus is
.Em 42 .
The
.Xr isdnd 8
.Em must
not currently running on that machine!
Executing:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
isdntest -i 42 -o 42
.Ed
.Pp
will setup an outgoing call from that machine to itself, connect to itself
and disconnect after 5 seconds.
The
.Nm
utility has to be finished by the user by entering Control-C.
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
utility and this manpage were written by
