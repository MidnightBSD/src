.Sh NAME
.Nm i4bing
.Nd isdn4bsd NetGraph ISDN B-channel interface driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd device \&"i4bing\&" Op count
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver interfaces the
.Fx
NetGraph subsystem with the
isdn4bsd package.
.Pp
The driver just packs packets received from the NetGraph subsystem without
anything appended or prepended into raw HDLC packets on the B channel and
transfers them to a remote site.
Packets received from the remote site are queued into the NetGraph
subsystem.
.Pp
In the case where a packet for a remote site arrives in the driver and no
connection has been established yet, the driver communicates with the
.Xr isdnd 8
daemon to establish a connection.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr netgraph 4 ,
.Xr isdnd.rc 5 ,

The
.Nm
device driver and this manpage were written by
