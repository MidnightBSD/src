.Sh NAME
.Nm pccard.conf
.Nd
.Xr pccardd 8
configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file is the configuration file for the
.Xr pccardd 8
PC-CARD slot management daemon.
It provides information to allow card
identification, and the matching of drivers (along
with driver resources) to the PC-CARD cards.
.Pp
There are four basic elements within the configuration file;
An optional
.Em "resource pool"
preceding the other sections,
and one or more
.Em "card identifiers" ,
and
.Em "device instances" .
The latter two may appear in any order, and may be
interspersed as desired.
.Pp
The
.Pa /etc/pccard.conf
file is included from the file
.Pa /etc/defaults/pccard.conf ,
which contains the default resource pool settings and
pccard identifiers database.
The user specific configuration can be specified in
.Pa /etc/pccard.conf
when the user wishes to override these defaults and/or
add additional entries.
.Pp
Each PC-CARD card contains configuration tuples that provide
the manufacturer and card version; these are used
to identify the card specification in the configuration
file, and from this find a driver that can be used to
interface to the particular card.
There is a many-to-one mapping
between cards to drivers i.e a single driver may interface to
multiple types of cards.
To aid this, card parameters may be
specified separately from the driver to initialize the card or
extract (in the case of a network card) an Ethernet address.
.Pp
Once a driver is allocated to a card, it stays
allocated to that particular card.
However, multiple instances of the same type of driver can be
configured, so that if two cards are plugged in that map to a
similar type of driver, other driver instances of the same name
can be configured.
.Pp
The
.Em insert
and
.Em remove
commands allow a shell command line to be executed.
The command to be executed is the rest of the line after
the keyword.
The line can be continued using a backslash.
A simple
macro substitution allows the current kernel device name
.Em ( $device )
and
network card Ethernet address
.Em ( $ether )
to be inserted into the command line.
.Xr pccardd 8
uses the
.Xr system 3
subroutine to execute the command line.
.Pp
.Xr pccardd 8
will use syslog to announce the insertion and removal of cards.
It uses either the string set by the
.Em logstr
command, or the manufacturer and card version strings if none has
been set.
.Pp
Numeric values may be expressed as octal, hex or decimal.
If a decimal number has
.Em k
or
.Em K
appended to it, the value is multiplied by 1024.
Names may be
quoted using double quotes if spaces are required.
A hash character comments out the rest of the line.
.Ss "Resource pool"
The (optional) section specifies a pool of system resources
such as ISA bus memory address space, Input/Output ports and
interrupt request numbers.
This resource pool is used
to allocate address space and interrupt numbers dynamically
according to the requirements specified in each driver
description.
.Pp
The syntax of the resources is as follows:
.Pp
.Dl io Ar start - end ...
.Dl memory Ar address size ...
.Dl irq Ar irq-number ...
.Pp
Each of the statements define I/O, memory or IRQ
blocks that can be used to allocate to drivers when
they are initialized.
.Pp
The syntax of the debuglevel parameter:
.Pp
.Dl debuglevel Ar level
.Pp
Multiple lines of any of the above statements may be
present to allow separate blocks of each resource to be
defined.
.Ss "Card Identifiers"
The syntax for card identifiers is:
.Pp
.Dl card Ar manufacturer version [ add_info1 [ add_info2 ]]
.Dl config Ar index driver interrupt [ flags ]
.Dl ether Ar offset
.Dl reset Ar time
.Dl iosize Ar size
.Dl memsize Ar size
.Dl insert Ar command
.Dl remove Ar command
.Dl logstr Ar string
.Pp
The first line is mandatory;
the latter statements are optional and can appear in
any order.
There may be multiple
.Em config
lines.
The
.Em card
parameters are the Manufacturer name, card version and
additional information add_info1, add_info2 that
is used to match the values from the card's CIS memory.
These parameters can be described in extended regular expression
.Xr regex 3
if the string is enclosed by '/' like "/.*/".
Each of the expressions is evaluated with a character '^' at top.
.Pp
The
.Em config
parameters select the particular card's configuration index
from the range available in the card's CIS, the driver that
is to be associated with this configuration, and the interrupt
level (if any) to be assigned.
An optional set of flags may
be assigned.
In
.Ar index ,
specify either
.Dq auto
or
.Dq default
or the range available in the card's CIS.
.Dq auto
allows to allocate resources automatically with information
from the CIS and status of using I/O resources.
.Pp
The optional
.Em ether
keyword is used when network cards have their physical Ethernet address
located within the attribute memory of the card.
The parameter of this
statement indicates the offset within the attribute memory of the
Ethernet address.
This value can be used within insert/remove
commands using the
.Em $ether
macro.
.Pp
The optional
.Em reset
keyword specifies reset duration at a card insertion in
.Ar time
milliseconds.
Default is 100msec.
.Pp
.Em iosize
and
.Em memsize
keywords are used with cards whose resources such as I/O ports and
shared memory block are not specified in the CIS tuple.
.Pp
The
.Em insert
and
.Em remove
sections allow shell commands to be specified that are executed
when the card is inserted or removed.
Multiple
.Em insert
and
.Em remove
commands are allowed, and they are executed in the order they
are listed.
.Pp
The
.Em logstr
command allows the user to set the string to be logged when this card is
inserted or removed.
If
.Em logstr
is not specified, then the manufacturer and
card version strings from the CIS are used to synthesize the string issued.
.Ss "Wildcard entries"
Following two wildcard entries of card identifiers are available
for generic type of the cards:
.Pp
.Dl generic serial
.Dl generic fixed_disk
.Pp
The keyword
.Em serial
matches
.Dq Functional ID: Serial port/modem
and
.Em fixed_disk
matches
.Dq Fixed disk card .
The syntax is the same as for
.Em "card identifiers"
but uses
.Dq generic
instead of
.Dq card
in the first line.
These are defined at the bottom of
.Nm
so unmatched cards use the generic entries.
The alias
.Dq function
can be used instead of
.Dq generic ,
this is supported due to historical reasons.
