.Sh NAME
.Nm nandtool
.Nd NAND devices swiss army knife
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar command
.Op Ar operands ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility can be used to perform various operations on
.Xr gnand 4
devices (read, write, erase,
read and write OOB area and to get info about NAND flash chip).
.Pp
The following commands are available:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm of Ns = Ns Ar file"
.It Cm read Ns
Read pages from NAND device.
.It Cm write Ns
Write pages to NAND device.
.It Cm erase Ns
Erase blocks.
Requires offset aligned to block granularity.
.It Cm info Ns
Get information about NAND chip (page size, block size, OOB area size, chip size
and media size)
.It Cm readoob Ns
Read OOB area from specified page.
.It Cm writeoob Ns
Write OOB area bound to specified page.
.It Cm help Ns
Get usage info.
.El
.Sh COMMAND read
The following operands are available for
.Nm
.Cm read
command:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm of Ns = Ns Ar file"
.It Cm dev Ns = Ns Ar <path>
Path to a
.Xr gnand 4
device node, required for all operations.
.It Cm out Ns = Ns Ar <file>
Output file path. If not specified, page contents
will be dumped to stdout in format similar to
.Xr hexdump 1
.It Cm page Ns = Ns Ar <n>
Offset on device, expressed as page number.
.It Cm block Ns = Ns Ar <n>
Offset on device, expressed as block number.
.It Cm pos Ns = Ns Ar <n>
Offset on device, expressed in bytes (however, must be aligned
to page granularity).
.It Cm count Ns = Ns Ar <n>
Count of objects (pages, blocks, bytes).
.El
.Sh COMMAND readoob
The following operands are available for
.Nm
.Cm readoob
command:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm of Ns = Ns Ar file"
.It Cm dev Ns = Ns Ar <path>
Path to NAND device node.
.It Cm page Ns = Ns Ar <n>
Offset on device, expressed as page number.
.It Cm out Ns = Ns Ar <file>
Output file path, optional.
.El
.Sh COMMAND write
The following operands are available for
.Nm
.Cm write
command:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm of Ns = Ns Ar file"
.It Cm dev Ns = Ns Ar <path>
Path to NAND device node.
.It Cm page Ns = Ns Ar <n>
Offset on device, expressed as page number.
.It Cm block Ns = Ns Ar <n>
Offset on device, expressed as block number.
.It Cm pos Ns = Ns Ar <n>
Offset on device, expressed in bytes (however, must be aligned
to page granularity).
.It Cm in Ns = Ns Ar <file>
Input file path.
.El
.Sh COMMAND writeoob
The following operands are available for
.Nm
.Cm writeoob
command:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm of Ns = Ns Ar file"
.It Cm dev Ns = Ns Ar <path>
Path to NAND device node.
.It Cm page Ns = Ns Ar <n>
Offset on device, expressed as page number.
.It Cm in Ns = Ns Ar <file>
Input file path.
.El
.Sh COMMAND erase
The following operands are available for
.Nm
.Cm erase
command:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm of Ns = Ns Ar file"
.It Cm dev Ns = Ns Ar <path>
Path to NAND device node.
.It Cm page Ns = Ns Ar <n>
Offset on device, expressed as page number.
.It Cm block Ns = Ns Ar <n>
Offset on device, expressed as block number.
.It Cm pos Ns = Ns Ar <n>
Offset on device, epressed in bytes (however, must be aligned
to block granularity).
.It Cm count Ns = Ns Ar <n>
Count of objects (pages, blocks, bytes).
.El
.Pp
WARNING: The only required parameter for the \fBerase\fP command is
.Ar dev .
When no other arguments are provided the whole device is erased!
.Sh COMMAND info
There is only one operand available for
.Nm
.Cm info
command:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm of Ns = Ns Ar file"
.It Cm dev Ns = Ns Ar <path>
Path to NAND device node.
.El
.Sh COMMAND help
There is only one operand available for
.Nm
.Cm help
command:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm of Ns = Ns Ar file"
.It Cm topic Ns = Ns Ar <name>

.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
If the supplied argument
.Ar dev
points to a device node other than gnand<num> or gnand.raw<num> both
.Nm
.Cm readoob
and
.Nm
.Cm writeoob
return error.
