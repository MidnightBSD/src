.Op Fl d Ar disk-path
.Op Fl h Ar host-path
.Op Fl e Ar name=value
.Op Fl c Ar cons-dev
.Ar vmname
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is used to load a
.Fx
guest inside a
.Xr bhyve 4
virtual machine.
.Pp
.Nm
is based on
.Xr loader 8
and will present an interface identical to the
.Fx
loader on the user's terminal.
.Pp
The virtual machine is identified as
.Ar vmname
and will be created if it does not already exist.
.Sh OPTIONS
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl m Ar mem-size Xo
.Sm off
.Op Cm K | k | M | m | G | g | T | t
.Xc

.Ar mem-size
is the amount of memory allocated to the guest.
.Pp
The
.Ar mem-size
argument may be suffixed with one of
.Cm K ,
.Cm M ,
.Cm G
or
.Cm T
(either upper or lower case) to indicate a multiple of
Kilobytes, Megabytes, Gigabytes or Terabytes
respectively.
.Pp
The default value of
.Ar mem-size
is 256M.
.It Fl d Ar disk-path
The
.Ar disk-path
is the pathname of the guest's boot disk image.
.It Fl h Ar host-path
The
.Ar host-path
is the directory at the top of the guest's boot filesystem.

.Pp
The option may be used more than once to set more than one environment
variable.
.It Fl c Ar cons-dev
.Ar cons-dev
is a
.Xr tty 4
device to use for
.Nm
terminal I/O.
.Pp
The text string "stdio" is also accepted and selects the use of
unbuffered standard I/O. This is the default value.

.Sh EXAMPLES
To create a virtual machine named
.Ar freebsd-vm
that boots off the ISO image
.Pa /freebsd/release.iso
and has 1GB memory allocated to it:
.Pp
.Dl "bhyveload -m 1G -d /freebsd/release.iso freebsd-vm"
.Pp
To create a virtual machine named
.Ar test-vm
with 256MB of memory allocated, the guest root filesystem under the host
directory
.Pa /user/images/test
and terminal I/O sent to the
.Xr nmdm 4
device
.Pa /dev/nmdm1B
.Pp
.Dl "bhyveload -m 256MB -h /usr/images/test -c /dev/nmdm1B test-vm"
