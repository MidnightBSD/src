.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility could be used to manage GPIO pins from userland and list available pins.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width ".Fl f Ar ctldev"
.It Fl c Ar pin Ar flag Op flag ...
Configure pin by setting provided flags. The following flags are currently defined:
.Bl -tag -offset indent -width ".Cm PULSE"
.It Cm IN
Input pin
.It Cm OUT
Output pin
