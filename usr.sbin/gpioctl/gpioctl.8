.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility could be used to manage GPIO pins from userland and list available pins.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width ".Fl f Ar ctldev"
.It Fl c Ar pin Ar flag Op flag ...
Configure pin by setting provided flags. The following flags are currently defined:
.Bl -tag -offset indent -width ".Cm PULSE"
.It Cm IN
Input pin
.It Cm OUT
Output pin
.It Cm OD
Open drain pin
.It Cm PP
Push pull pin
.It Cm TS

.It Cm PU
Pull-up pin
.It Cm PD
Pull-down pin
.It Cm II
Inverted input pin
.It Cm IO
Inverted output pin
.El
.It Fl f Ar ctldev
GPIO controller device to use
If not specified, defaults to
.Pa /dev/gpioc0
.It Fl l
list available pins
.It Fl t Ar pin
