 * Binder entry point.  Control is transferred to here by code in the PLT.
 * On entry, there are two arguments on the stack.  In ascending address
 * order, they are (1) "obj", a pointer to the calling object's Obj_Entry,
 * and (2) "reloff", the byte offset of the appropriate relocation entry
 * in the PLT relocation table.

 * We are careful to preserve all registers, even the caller-save
 * registers.  That is because this code may be invoked by low-level
