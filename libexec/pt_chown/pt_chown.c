/*
 * pt_chown
 * Utility support routine for grantpt(3).
 *
 * According to IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, grantpt(3) changes ownership and
 * permission bits of a slave pseudo-terminal device associated with a
 * master.
 *
 * Since doing this if we are not the owner of the slave (which would
 * rarely happen) cannot be done by conventional methods, grantpt(3)
 * has to rely on this support program, which is setuid root, to change
 * the slave's owner, group, and permission mode attributes.  It's
 * a rather undesirable approach, but Digital Unix and Solaris also seem
 * to rely on this approach to pull this off.
 *
 * This program hangs around long enough to do just these things upon
 * its standard input (which is set up by grantpt(3) to be the master's
 * descriptor, the one passed to it).  The rationale behind this
 * approach not allowing somebody to modify ownership of another active
 * pseudo terminal is:
 *
 * 1)  This program only operates on its standard input.  If STDIN_FILENO
 *     is not open or is not a pseudo-terminal master, no action is
 *     taken and the program exits (ptsname() is called for a non-NULL
 *     return).
 * 2)  Only one active file description for a pseudo-terminal master
 *     can exist at a time (attempting to open an active PTY returns with
 *     EIO - I/O Error).  Thus, if the pseudo-terminal is already in
 *     use by somebody else, it could not have been opened to begin
 *     with, and thus this program would be useless in such situations.
