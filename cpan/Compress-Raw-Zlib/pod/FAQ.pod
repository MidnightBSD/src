Compress::Raw::Zlib::FAQ -- Frequently Asked Questions about Compress::Raw::Zlib

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Common questions answered.

=head2 Compatibility with Unix compress/uncompress.

This module is not compatible with Unix C<compress>.

If you have the C<uncompress> program available, you can use this to read
compressed files

    open F, "uncompress -c $filename |";
    while (<F>)
    {
        ...

Alternatively, if you have the C<gunzip> program available, you can use
this to read compressed files

    open F, "gunzip -c $filename |";
    while (<F>)
    {
        ...

and this to write compress files, if you have the C<compress> program
available

    open F, "| compress -c $filename ";
    print F "data";
    ...
    close F ;

=head2 Accessing .tar.Z files

See previous FAQ item.

If the C<Archive::Tar> module is installed and either the C<uncompress> or
C<gunzip> programs are available, you can use one of these workarounds to
read C<.tar.Z> files.

Firstly with C<uncompress>

    use strict;
    use warnings;
    use Archive::Tar;

    open F, "uncompress -c $filename |";
    my $tar = Archive::Tar->new(*F);
    ...

and this with C<gunzip>

    use strict;
    use warnings;
    use Archive::Tar;

    open F, "gunzip -c $filename |";
    my $tar = Archive::Tar->new(*F);
    ...

Similarly, if the C<compress> program is available, you can use this to
write a C<.tar.Z> file

    use strict;
    use warnings;
    use Archive::Tar;
    use IO::File;

    my $fh = new IO::File "| compress -c >$filename";
    my $tar = Archive::Tar->new();
    ...
    $tar->write($fh);
    $fh->close ;

=head2 Zlib Library Version Support

By default C<Compress::Raw::Zlib> will build with a private copy of version
1.2.5 of the zlib library. (See the F<README> file for details of
how to override this behaviour)

If you decide to use a different version of the zlib library, you need to be
aware of the following issues

=over 5

=item *

First off, you must have zlib 1.0.5 or better.

=item *

You need to have zlib 1.2.1 or better if you want to use the C<-Merge>
option with C<IO::Compress::Gzip>, C<IO::Compress::Deflate> and
C<IO::Compress::RawDeflate>.
