DESCRIPTION
-----------

This distribution provides a Perl interface to allow reading and writing of
compressed data created with the zlib and bzip2 libraries.

IO-Compress supports reading and writing of bzip2, RFC 1950, RFC
1951, RFC 1952 (i.e. gzip) and zip files/buffers.

The following modules used to be distributed separately, but are now
included with the IO-Compress distribution.

    Compress-Zlib
    IO-Compress-Zlib
    IO-Compress-Bzip2
    IO-Compress-Base

PREREQUISITES
-------------

Before you can build IO-Compress you need to have the following
installed on your system:

    * Perl 5.004 or better. 
    * Compress::Raw::Zlib
    * Compress::Raw::Bzip2

BUILDING THE MODULE
-------------------

Assuming you have met all the prerequisites, the module can now be built
using this sequence of commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test

INSTALLATION
------------

To install IO-Compress, run the command below:

    make install

TROUBLESHOOTING

FEEDBACK
--------

How to report a problem with IO-Compress.

To help me help you, I need all of the following information:

 1. The Versions of everything relevant.
    This includes:

     a. The *complete* output from running this
     
            perl -V
     
        Do not edit the output in any way.
        Note, I want you to run "perl -V" and NOT "perl -v".
     
        If your perl does not understand the "-V" option it is too
        old. This module needs Perl version 5.004 or better.     

     b. The version of IO-Compress you have. 
        If you have successfully installed IO-Compress, this one-liner
        will tell you:

           perl -MIO::Compress::Gzip -e 'print qq[ver $IO::Compress::Gzip::VERSION\n]'

        If you are  running windows use this

           perl -MIO::Compress::Gzip -e "print qq[ver $IO::Compress::Gzip::VERSION\n]"

        If you haven't installed IO-Compress then search IO::Compress::Gzip.pm
        for a line like this:

          $VERSION = "2.033" ;

 2. If you are having problems building IO-Compress, send me a
    complete log of what happened. Start by unpacking the IO-Compress
    module into a fresh directory and keep a log of all the steps

        [edit config.in, if necessary]
        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test TEST_VERBOSE=1
