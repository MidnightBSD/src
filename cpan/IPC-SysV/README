The SysV-IPC contains three packages

    IPC::Semaphore
    - Provides an object interface to using SysV IPC semaphores

    IPC::Msg
    - Provides an object interface to using SysV IPC messages

    IPC::SysV
    - Provides the constants required to use the system SysV IPC calls.

Currently there is not object support for SysV shared memory, but
SysV::SharedMem is a project for the future.

Share and enjoy!
