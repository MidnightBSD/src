Revision history for Perl module Unicode::Collate.

0.73  Sun Mar  6 13:24:22 2011
    - DUCET is updated (for Unicode 6.0.0) as Collate/allkeys.txt.
    ! However no maint perl has supported Unicode 6.0.0 yet;
      wait for 5.14, or try developing 5.13.7 or later.
    ! Please notice that allkeys.txt will be overwritten if you have had
      other allkeys.txt already.
    - The default UCA_Version is 22. Locale/*.pl and Korean.pm are updated.
    - test: compare allkeys.txt's version with Base_Unicode_Version
      in t/default.t.

0.72  Sat Jan 22 17:28:32 2011
    - xs: fix mixing char* and U8*.

0.71  Tue Jan 18 22:29:44 2011
    - t/loc_test.t should not fail without Unicode::Normalize.

0.70  Sun Jan 16 20:31:07 2011
    - Now U::C::Locale->new will use the compiled DUCET via XS if available.
      added some tests in t/loc_test.t.

0.69  Sat Jan 15 19:41:11 2011
    - clarified about XSUB. revised INSTALL in README.
    - xs: flag passed to utf8n_to_uvuni().
    - doc and comments: [perl #81876] Fix typos by Peter J. Acklam.

0.68  Tue Nov 23 20:17:22 2010
    - doc: clarified about (backwards => [ ]) and (backwards => undef).
    - separated t/backwds.t from t/test.t.
    - added cjk_b5.t, cjk_gb.t, cjk_ja.t, cjk_ko.t, cjk_py.t, cjk_st.t in t
      for CJK/*.pm without Locale.pm.

0.67  Sun Nov 14 11:38:59 2010
    - supported UCA_Version 22 for Unicode 6.0.0.
      * 2B740..2B81D are new CJK unified ideographs.
      * noncharacters (e.g. U+FFFF) should be overridable, not be ignored.
    ! DUCET is NOT updated, as no maint perl supports Unicode 6.0.0.
      Thus the default UCA_Version is still 20.
    - added t/nonchar.t.
    - improved discontiguous contractions of 3 or more characters.
      (e.g. 0FB2 0F71 0F80 and 0FB3 0F71 0F80)
    - auxiliary: now 'mklocale' also copes with Korean.pm according to DUCET.

0.66  Sun Nov  7 10:47:30 2010
    - U::C::Locale newly supports locale: ko.
    - added Unicode::Collate::CJK::Korean for ko.
    - added t/loc_ko.t.
    - 12 compat. ideographs (e.g. U+FA0E) are treated as unified ideographs.
     (though DUCET also does it, now Unicode::Collate does it without DUCET.)
    - added t/compatui.t.
    ! Ideographs Ext.B (U+20000..U+2A6D6) can be overridden with UCA_Version 8.
      This is a long-standing behavior from Unicode::Collate 0.11 to 0.63.
      A wrong fix at 0.64 should be abandoned.

0.65  Wed Nov  3 13:10:20 2010
    - U::C::Locale newly supports locale: zh and its some variants.
     (zh__big5han, zh__gb2312han, zh__pinyin, zh__stroke)
    - added Unicode::Collate::CJK::Big5   for zh__big5han.
    - added Unicode::Collate::CJK::GB2312 for zh__gb2312han.
    - added Unicode::Collate::CJK::Pinyin for zh__pinyin.
    - added Unicode::Collate::CJK::Stroke for zh__stroke.
    - added loc_zh.t, loc_zhb5.t, loc_zhgb.t, loc_zhpy.t, loc_zhst.t in t.

0.64  Sun Oct 31 14:17:29 2010
    - U::C::Locale newly supports locale: ja.
    - added Unicode::Collate::CJK::JISX0208 for ja.
    - added loc_ja.t, loc_jait.t, loc_japr.t in t.
    - a subroutine specified in 'overrideCJK' or 'overrideHangul' is allowed
      to return an integer or undef value.
    - fix: Ideographs Ext.B (U+20000..U+2A6D6) are assigned in Unicode 3.1,
           then 'overrideCJK' should not override them with UCA_Version 8.
      !! sorry, this fix is based on a wrong idea. reverted at 0.66. !!
    - separated t/overcjk0.t and t/overcjk1.t from t/override.t.

0.63  Sun Oct 10 22:13:21 2010
    - supported suppress contractions (see 'suppress' in POD).
    - internal for 'hangul_terminator' in getSortKey().
    - U::C::Locale newly supports locales: be, bg, kk, mk, ru, sr.
    - added loc_be.t, loc_bg.t, loc_cyrl.t, loc_kk.t, loc_mk.t, loc_ru.t,
      loc_sr.t in t.
    - added tailoring with U+0340 or U+0341 instead of U+0300 or U+0301.
        (affected locales: hr, is, pl, se, to, wo)

0.62  Wed Oct  6 21:35:54 2010
    - U::C::Locale newly supports locales: ar, hu, hy, se, to, uk.
    - added loc_ar.t, loc_hu.t, loc_hy.t, loc_se.t, loc_to.t, loc_uk.t in t.
    - Vietnamese (vi): added tailoring for U+0340 and U+0341.

0.61  Sat Oct  2 11:41:29 2010
    - U::C::Locale newly supports locales: hr, ig, sq.
    - added loc_hr.t, loc_ig.t, loc_sq.t in t.
    - precomposites of e-dot-below, o-dot-below, o-tilde are tailored as well.
        (affected locales: et, yo)
    - Vietnamese (vi): added contractions for non-blocked decompositions
      * base + dot-below + mark such as a\x{323}\x{306}, \x{1EA1}\x{306} etc.
      * base + tone + horn such as o\x{309}\x{31B}, \x{1ECF}\x{31B} etc.

0.60  Thu Sep 23 21:37:36 2010
    - bug fix: index() [and its friends including gmatch()] didn't remove
      ignorable characters in the substring correctly.
      Thanks for the bug report:
  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl-unicode/2010-09/msg00014.html

    - U::C::Locale newly supports locales: de__phonebook, nso, om, tn, vi.

    - U::C::Locale newly supports locales: ca, et, fi, lv, sk, sl.
    - added loc_ca.t, loc_et.t, loc_fi.t, loc_lv.t, loc_sk.t, loc_sl.t in t.

0.56  Sun Aug  8 20:24:03 2010
    - Unicode::Collate::Locale newly supports locales: eo, nb, ro, sv.
    - added loc_eo.t, loc_es.t, loc_estr.t, loc_nb.t, loc_ro.t, loc_sv.t in t.
    ! renamed t/locale_{xy}.t to t/loc_{xy}.t (for safer 8.3 names)
     (loc_cs.t, loc_fr.t, loc_nn.t, loc_pl.t, loc_test.t)

0.55  Sun Aug  1 21:21:23 2010
    - incorporated Unicode::Collate::Locale with some changes. see:
  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl-unicode/2004-03/msg00030.html
    - supported locales: cs, es, es__traditional, fr, nn, pl.
    ! added t/locale*.t that uses DUCET.
     (locale_cs.t, locale_fr.t, locale_nn.t, locale_pl.t, locale_test.t)
    - data/*.txt and mklocale for preparation of Locale/*.pl from DUCET.

0.54  Sun Jul 25 21:37:04 2010
    - Now UCA Revision 20 (based on Unicode 5.2.0).
    - DUCET is also updated (for Unicode 5.2.0) as Collate/allkeys.txt,
      which *is required* to test this module.
    ! Please notice that allkeys.txt will be overwritten if you have had
      other allkeys.txt already.
    - U+9FC4..U+9FCB and U+2A700..U+2B734 are new CJK unified ideographs.
    - Many hangul jamo are assigned (affecting hangul_terminator).

    ! Now XSUB will be built by default. (XSUB needs a C compiler.)
      To build pure perl, run disableXS before Makefile.PL.
    ! DUCET will be compiled when XS is used. Explicit saying
      <table => 'allkeys.txt'> (or using another table) will prevent
      this module from using the compiled DUCET.

    ! added t/default.t that uses DUCET.

0.53  Sun Feb 14 20:46:27 2010
    - Now UCA Revision 18 (based on Unicode 5.1.0).
    - DUCET is also updated (for Unicode 5.1.0) as Collate/allkeys.txt,
      which is not required to test this module.
    ! Please notice that allkeys.txt will be overwritten if you have had
      other allkeys.txt already.
    - U+9FBC..U+9FC3 are new CJK unified ideographs.

0.52  Thu Oct 13 21:51:09 2005
    - The Unicode::Collate->new method does not destroy user's $_ any longer.
      (thanks to Jon Warbrick for bug report)

0.51  Sun May 29 20:21:19 2005
    - Added the latest DUCET (for Unicode 4.1.0) as Collate/allkeys.txt,
      which is not required to test this module.
    ! Please notice that allkeys.txt will be overwritten if you have had
      other allkeys.txt already.
    - Added INSTALL section in POD.

0.50  Sun May  8 20:26:39 2005
    - Now UCA Revision 14 (based on Unicode 4.1.0).
    - Some tests are modified.
    - Added cjkrange.t, ignor.t, override.t in t.
    - Added META.yml.

0.40  Sat Apr 24 06:54:40 2004
    - Now a table file is searched in @INC.

0.33  Sat Dec 13 14:07:27 2003
    - documentation improvement: in "entry", "overrideHangul", etc.

0.32  Wed Dec  3 23:38:18 2003
    - A matching part from index(), match() etc. will include illegal
      code points (as well as ignorable characters) following a grapheme.
    - Contraction with illegal code point will be invalid.
    - Added t/view.t.
    - Added some tests in t/illegal.t.
    - Separated t/altern.t and t/rearrang.t from t/test.t.
    - modified XSUB internals.

0.31  Sun Nov 16 15:40:15 2003
    - Illegal code points (surrogate and noncharacter; they are definitely
      ignorable) will be distinguished from NULL ("\0");
      but porting is not successful in the case of ((Pure Perl) and
      (Perl 5.7.3 or before)). If perl 5.6.X is used, XSUB may help it
      in place of broken CORE::unpack('U*') in older perl.
    - added illegal.t and illegalp.t in t.
    - added XSUB where some functions are implemented in XSUB.
      Pure Perl is also supported.

0.30  Mon Oct 13 21:26:37 2003
    - fix: Completely ignorable in table should be able to be overridden
      by non-ignorable in entry.
    - fix: Maximum length for contraction must not be shortened
      by a shorter contraction following in table and/or entry.
    - added t/normal.t.
    - some doc fixes

0.29  Mon Oct 13 12:18:23 2003
    - now UCA Version 11 (but no functionality is different from Version 9).
    - supported hangul_terminator.
    - fix: Base_Unicode_Version falsely returns Perl's Unicode version.
      C4 in UTS #10 requires UTS's Unicode version.
    - For variable weighting, 'variable' is recommended
      and 'alternate' is deprecated.
    - added version() method.
    - added hangtype.t, trailwt.t, variable.t, and version.t in t.

0.28  Sat Sep 06 20:16:01 2003
    - Fixed another inconsistency under (normalization => undef):
      Non-contiguous contraction is always neglected.
    - Fixed: according to S2.1 in UTS #10, a blocked combining character
      should not be contracted. One test in t/test.t was wrong, then removed.
    - Added t/contract.t.
    - (normalization => "prenormalized") is able to be used.

0.27  Sun Aug 31 22:23:17 2003
      some improvements:
    - The maximum length of contracted CE was not checked (v0.22 to v0.26).
      Collation of a large string including a first letter of a contraction
      that is not a part of that contraction (say, 'c' of 'ca'
      where 'ch' is defined) was too slow, inefficient.
    - A form name for 'normalization', no longer restricted to
      /^(?:NF)?K?[CD]\z/, will be allowed as long as
      Unicode::Normalize::normalize() accepts it, since Unicode::Normalize
      or UAX #15 may be changed/enhanced in future.
    - When Hangul syllables are decomposed under <normalization => undef>,
      contraction among jamo (LV, VT, LVT) derived from the same
      Hangul syllable is allowed.
    - Added t/hangul.t.

0.26  Sun Aug 03 22:23:17 2003
    - fix: an expansion in which a CE is level 3 ignorable and others are not
      was wrongly made level 3 ignorable as a whole entry.
      (In DUCET, some precomposites in Musical Symbols are so)

0.25  Mon Jun 06 23:20:17 2003
    - fix Makefile.PL.
    - internal tweak (again): pack_U() and unpack_U().

0.24  Thu Apr 02 23:12:54 2003
    - internal tweak for (?un)pack 'U'.

0.23  Wed Sep 04 19:25:20 2002
    - fix: scalar match() no longer returns an lvalue substr ref.
    - fix: "Ignorable after variable" should be made level 3 ignorable
           even if alternate => 'blanked'.
    - Now a grapheme may contain trailing level 2, level 3,
      and completely ignorable characters.

0.22  Mon Sep 02 23:15:14 2002
    - New File: t/index.t.
      (The new t/test.t excludes tests for index.)
    - tweak on index(). POSITION is supported.
    - add match, gmatch, subst, gsubst methods.
    - fix: ignorable after variable in 'shift'-variable weight.

0.21  Sat Aug 03 10:24:00 2002
    - upgrade keys.txt and t/test.t for UCA Version 9.

0.20  Fri Jul 26 02:15:25 2002
    - now UCA Version 9.
    - U+FDD0..U+FDEF are new non-characters.
    - fix: whitespace characters before @backwards etc. in a table file.
    - now values for 'alternate', 'backwards', etc.,
      which are explicitly specified via new(),
      are preferred to those specified in a table file.

0.12  Sun May 05 09:43:10 2002
    - add new methods, ->UCA_Version and ->Base_Unicode_Version.
    - test fix: removed the needless requirement of Unicode::Normalize.
      [reported by David Hand]

0.11  Fri May 03 02:28:10 2002
    - fix: now derived collation elements can be used for Hangul Jamo
      when their weights are not defined.
      [reported by Andreas J. Koenig]
    - fix: rearrangements had not worked.
    - mentioned pleblem on index() in BUGS.
    - more documents, more tests.
    - tag names for 'alternate' are case-insensitive (i.e. 'SHIFTed' etc.).
    - The <undef> value for the keys "overrideCJK", "overrideHangul",
      "rearrange" has a special behavior (different from default).

0.10  Tue Dec 11 23:26:42 2001
    - now you are allowed to use no table file.
    - fix: fetching CE with two or more combining characters.

0.09  Sun Nov 11 17:02:40:18 2001
    - add the following methods: eq, ne, lt, le, gt, le.
    - relies on &Unicode::Normalize::getCombinClass()
      in place of %Unicode::Normalize::Combin
      (the hash is not defined in the XS version of Unicode::Normalize).
      then you should install Unicode::Normalize 0.10 or later.
    - now independent of Lingua::KO::Hangul::Util
      (this module does decomposition of Hangul syllables for itself)

0.08  Mon Aug 20 22:40:18 2001
    - add the index method.

0.07  Thu Aug 16 23:42:02 2001
    - rename the module name to Unicode::Collate.

0.06  Thu Aug 16 23:18:36 2001
    - add description of the getSortKey method.

0.05  Mon Aug 13 22:23:11 2001
    - bug fix: on the things of 4.2.1, UTR #10
    - getSortKey returns a string, but not an arrayref.

0.04  Mon Aug 13 22:23:11 2001
    - some bugs are fixed.
    - some tailoring parameters are added.

0.03  Mon Aug 06 06:26:35 2001
    - modify README

0.02  Sun Aug 05 20:20:01 2001
    - some fix

0.01  Sun Jul 29 16:16:15 2001
    - original version; created by h2xs 1.21
      with options -A -X -n Sort::UCA
