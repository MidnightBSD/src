Revision history for CPAN-Meta

2.110440  2011-02-12 22:55:28 EST5EDT

  [BUGFIX]

  - Bump Parse::CPAN::Meta prereq to 1.44, as 1.43 was never released

2.110420  2011-02-11 15:40:36 EST5EDT

  [BUG FIXES]

  - The as_string() method now always returns a character string;
    previously, JSON strings were UTF-8 encoded.

  - The save() method now always saves with UTF-8 encoding for
    Perl 5.8.1 or greater; previously, YAML was not encoded

2.110390  2011-02-07 21:00:47 EST5EDT

  [BUG FIXES]

  - Release 2.110360 had a regression where the save() method would no
    longer return true on success.  That has been fixed.

2.110360  2011-02-04 19:46:21 America/New_York

  [OTHER]

  - Remove autodie dependency so CPAN::Meta can be used on older Perls

  - Remove unused Data::Dumper dependency

2.110350  2011-02-03 19:57:32 America/New_York

  [ENHANCEMENTS]

  - Added "as_string" method similar to "as_struct"

  [OTHER]

  - Bumped Parse::CPAN::Meta prereq to 1.43 and uses that to
    determine proper YAML/JSON backends

  - Removed unused prereqs

2.110330  2011-02-02 09:42:57 EST5EDT

  [ENHANCEMENTS]

  - Saved META.json files are now sorted by key

  - as_struct() method takes an optional "version" argument to return
    a down-converted metadata hashref

2.110320  2011-01-31 23:14:30 EST5EDT

  [ENHANCEMENTS]

  - The 'save' method now allows an optional hashref argument, which can be
    used to set the desired meta spec version.  Metadata is automatically
    converted to the specified output.

2.110240  2011-01-24 16:28:25 EST5EDT

  - Reading JSON/YAML is delegated entirely to Parse::CPAN::Meta (1.4200)
  
  - JSON.pm is dropped as a prerequisite and JSON::PP is added to prepare
    for CPAN::Meta to be added to the Perl core

  - JSON writing uses the same JSON backend selection as Parse::CPAN::Meta
    to allow "upgrading" to a non-core JSON backend module if desired

2.102400  2010-08-28 14:06:34 America/New_York

  - 'as_struct' method now returns unblessed data (reported by Chris Prather)

2.102160  2010-08-04 12:27:10 EST5EDT

  - Fix bugtracker conversion bug (RT#60017)
    
2.101670  2010-06-15 21:02:42 EST5EDT

  - converting 1.x 'repository' field now puts converted url into the
    'url' sub-field of 'repository' instead of the 'web' sub-field

2.101610  2010-06-10 18:51:30 EST5EDT

  - fixed converter bug that output 'artistic2' instead of 'artistic_2'
    for license in 1.X specs

  - 'artistic2' is now converted to 'artistic_2' if it occurs

  - corrected validation for 'artistic_2' and disallowed 'artistic-2.0'

2.101600  2010-06-09 10:07:31 EST5EDT

  - improve conversion of restricted/restrictive license keys between
    spec versions 1.4 and 2 [reported by Alexander Hartmaier]

2.101591  2010-06-08 09:56:17 EST5EDT

  - added 'as_struct' method to CPAN::Meta to get a deep copy of
    the metadata hash_ref

  - won't add an optional_features 'description' field if missing

  - improved documentation of CPAN::Meta::Converter and how it deals
    with bad/missing data

2.101590  2010-06-07 21:49:36 EST5EDT

  - won't automatically add 'unknown' as repository type when converting; 
    instead, will only add a repository type if a repository 'url' is
    present and it is of the 'svn:' or 'git:' scheme.

  - squelched some uninitialized value warnings [Graham Barr]

2.101580  2010-06-07 16:44:13 EST5EDT

  - add "lazy_validation" option to constructors

  - add ability to "convert" to same version and clean-up any fixable
    errors

  - fix validation bugs (adhere closer to the spec)

  - improve lots of heuristics during conversion

2.101461  2010-05-26 16:57:02 America/New_York

  - accessors deep clone list and map keys before returning them

  - add custom_keys() and custom() methods

2.101460  2010-05-25 23:12:27 America/New_York

  - loosen URL validation -- only a scheme and authority are required
    without restrictions on either

2.101450  2010-05-25 17:59:32 America/New_York

  - when downconverting from 2, leave custom keys unchanged
    (except in resources, where x_ is changed to X_)

  - when converting to 2, don't prepend x_ to custom keys that already
    matched qr{\Ax_}i

2.101410  2010-05-21 10:39:18 EST5EDT

  - when downconverting from 2, merge test requirements into build requirements

2.101390  2010-05-19 10:49:50 EST5EDT

  - do not clobber generated_by when converting

2.101380  2010-05-17 23:39:23 EST5EDT

  - added support for down-converting to older versions of the spec

  - improved test coverage for conversion and validation

2.101110  2010-04-21 11:06:52 EST5EDT

  - clarified that .XXXXXX versions of the CPAN-Meta distribution will not
    change the meaning of the CPAN::Meta::Spec, but may fix typos or
    clarify prose

  - fixed a typo regarding dotted-integer versions: keeping components
    in the range 0-999 was corrected to a "should" instead of a "must"

  - fixed validation bugs for certain types of nested data structures
    (based on a patch provided by Barbie)

2.101091  2010-04-19 06:32:13 EST5EDT

  - keep the old specs from getting indexed so as not to confuse people
