[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mMakemap [22mcreates the database maps used by  the  keyed  map  lookups  in
       sendmail(8).   It  reads input from the standard input and outputs them
       to the indicated [4mmapname.[0m

       Depending on how it is compiled,  [1mmakemap  [22mhandles  different  database
       formats, selected using the [4mmaptype[24m parameter.  They may be

       dbm    DBM format maps.  This requires the ndbm(3) library.

       btree  B-Tree  format maps.  This requires the new Berkeley DB library.

       hash   Hash format maps.  This also requires the Berkeley DB library.

       cdb    CDB (Constant DataBase) format maps.  This requires the  tinycdb
              library.

       implicit
              The  first  available  format in the following order: hash, dbm,
              and cdb.

       In all cases, [1mmakemap [22mreads lines from the standard input consisting of
       two words separated by white space.  The first is the database key, the
       second is the value.  The value may contain ``%[4mn[24m'' strings to  indicate
       parameter  substitution.   Literal percents should be doubled (``%%'').
       Blank lines and lines beginning with ``#'' are ignored.

       Notice: do [1mnot [22muse  [1mmakemap  [22mto  create  the  aliases  data  base,  but
       [1mnewaliases  [22mwhich  puts  a  special  token  into  the data base that is
       required by [1msendmail.[0m

       If the [4mTrustedUser[24m option is set in the sendmail configuration file and
       [1mmakemap  [22mis  invoked  as root, the generated files will be owned by the
       specified [4mTrustedUser.[0m

   [1mFlags[0m
       [1m-C     [22mUse the specified [1msendmail [22mconfiguration file for looking up the
              TrustedUser option.

       [1m-N     [22mInclude  the null byte that terminates strings in the map.  This
              must match the -N flag in the sendmail.cf ``K'' line.

       [1m-c     [22mUse the specified hash and B-Tree cache size.

       [1m-D     [22mUse to specify the character to use to indicate a comment (which
              is ignored) instead of the default of '#'.

       [1m-d     [22mAllow duplicate keys in the map.  This is only allowed on B-Tree
              format maps.  If two identical keys are read, they will both  be
              inserted into the map.

       [1m-e     [22mAllow empty value (right hand side).

       [1m-f     [22mNormally  all  upper case letters in the key are folded to lower
              case.  This flag disables that behaviour.  This is  intended  to
              mesh  with  the -f flag in the [1mK [22mline in sendmail.cf.  The value
              is never case folded.

       [1m-l     [22mList supported map types.

       [1m-o     [22mAppend to an old file.  This allows you to augment  an  existing
              file.   Note: this might not be supported by all database types,
              e.g., cdb.

       [1m-r     [22mAllow replacement of existing keys.  Normally [1mmakemap  [22mcomplains
              if you repeat a key, and does not do the insert.

       [1m-s     [22mIgnore  safety  checks  on  maps  being  created.  This includes
              checking for hard or symbolic links in world  writable  directo-
              ries.

       [1m-t     [22mUse  the  specified  delimiter  instead of white space (also for
              dumping a map).

       [1m-u     [22mdump (unmap) the content of the database to standard output.

       [1m-v     [22mVerbosely print what it is doing.
